        - prompt 1: |
            I want to write a bank of physics problems for introductory level physics students involving projectil motion. Those problems involve projectiles either thrown horizontally from a given height and land below, or launched from the ground at an angle, and reaches a target at the peak of its trajectory. First, create a table with 20 rows and 4 columns named: Direction, Context, height, distance. The four columns need to be filled as follows:
                Direction: The first 10 rows should be "up", and the next 10 rows should be "down"
                Context: For "up" direction, a brief description of a problem context involving a small object being launched towards a target that is higher up. For example, throwing a key towards a friend on 3rd floor, kicking a ball at a target, etc. For "down" direction, a problem context involving a small object being thrown horizontally from somewhere high above (with a horizontal velocity), such as a bridge, a building, a cliff, or similar situations. For both situations, avoid soft objects such as ropes or animals. 
                Height: A context appropriate number representing the height of either the target (for up) or the origin (for down).
                Distance: A context appropriate number representing the horizontal distance the object lands away from the thrower.
        - prompt 2: |
            Next, add four columns to the table by computing the following values, using g = 9.81, height is h and distance is d:
                v_y = \sqrt(2*g*h)
                v_x = d/\sqrt(2h/g)
                v = \sqrt(v_x^2 + v_y^2)
                theta (absolute) = arctan(v_y/v_x)
        - prompt 3: |
            Now add two more columns to the table: "Given" and "Ask for". They should be semi-randomly selected from the following set, but obeying the rules in the parenthesis: Given: v_x, h, Ask for: v (Both up and down directions) Given: v_x, h, Ask for: d (only associated with "down" direction). Given: v_x, h, Ask for: \theta (both up and down directions) Given: v, \theta, ask for: d (only associate with "up" direction).

        - prompt 4: | # Used GPT-4o for better output for the first batch. Need to upload the previously generated CSV table. Gemini-2.5 Pro yields much better results.
            I am writing quiz problems for college introductory level physics students according to parameters given in a table. Try and write the problem text with the question for rows 6 and 7 of the attached table.
            Only the variables in the "Given" column should be provided with numerical values. Other variables in the table should strictly not be given in the problem body. Explain each given variable, for example, \theta is the angle at which the [object] is launched, measured against the horizontal direction. For all "up" problems, if v_x is given, it should explained as being the horizontal velocity at which the object hits the target. Also point out that the object hits the target at the top of its trajectory, but don't say that the vertical velocity is zero. When the unknown variable is v or \theta, ask students to find the magnitude of velocity or launch angle.
            Replace abstract language such as "object" and "target" with in-context language specific to the problem context. 
            Math equations should be inline with the text. The question should not preceded by "Question:". Append the answer at the end in the form of "Answer:", using the value contained in the table.

          1. **Model the motion:** The keychain reaches the balcony at the highest point of its path. Treat the motion as projectile motion with launch speed <latex>v</latex> at angle <latex>\theta</latex> above the horizontal, with negligible air resistance and constant <latex>g</latex>.

          2. **Time to the top:** The time to reach the highest point is  
          <latex>t_{\text{top}}=\frac{v\sin\theta}{g}.</latex>

          3. **Horizontal speed:** The horizontal component of the launch speed is constant,  
          <latex>v_x = v\cos\theta.</latex>

          4. **Horizontal distance to the balcony:** Multiply horizontal speed by time to the top:  
          <latex>
          d = v_x\, t_{\text{top}} = (v\cos\theta)\left(\frac{v\sin\theta}{g}\right)
          = \frac{v^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g}
          = \frac{v^2\sin(2\theta)}{2g}.

          **Step-by-step solution for Problem 2 (soccer ball to stadium banner)**

          1. **Model the motion:** The banner is reached at the top of the ball’s flight. Treat this as projectile motion with constant horizontal speed <latex>v_x</latex> and constant gravitational acceleration <latex>g</latex>.

          2. **Relate height to the vertical launch component:** The vertical rise from launch to the top is <latex>h</latex>. For projectile motion, the vertical launch component satisfies

Here, <latex>h</latex> is the vertical height and <latex>v_x</latex> is the horizontal velocity at which the water bottle is caught. What is the launch angle, <latex>\theta</latex>, of the water bottle, measured with respect to the horizontal?  

      Round your answer to 1 decimal place

    feedback:
        general: |
          ### Solving for the Launch Angle 

          This problem asks for the initial launch angle (<latex>\theta</latex>) of the water bottle. We can find it by determining the initial horizontal (<latex>v_{0x}</latex>) and vertical (<latex>v_{0y}</latex>) components of the velocity and using trigonometry.

          **Step 1: Analyze the Motion**  
          Break the problem into two parts: horizontal and vertical.  
          * In the horizontal direction, velocity (<latex>v_x</latex>) is constant.  
          * In the vertical direction, gravity acts with <latex>g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2</latex>.  

          At the top of the trajectory, the vertical velocity is momentarily zero (<latex>v_y = 0</latex>).  

          **Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components**  
          * Horizontal velocity: <latex>v_{0x} = v_x = 3.62 \text{ m/s}</latex>.  
          * Vertical velocity: Use <latex>v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y</latex> with <latex>v_y=0</latex>, <latex>\Delta y = h</latex>, and <latex>a=-g</latex> to find <latex>v_{0y}</latex>.  

          **Step 3: Calculate the Launch Angle (<latex>\theta</latex>)**  
          With both components, apply the tangent function:  
          <latex>\tan(\theta) = \frac{v_{0y}}{v_{0x}}</latex>  

          Finally, take the inverse tangent to solve for <latex>\theta</latex>, giving the launch angle of about **71.6°**.

      A climber throws a carabiner to a partner higher on the rock wall. The carabiner is thrown with an initial velocity of <latex>v = 15.1 \text{ m/s}</latex> at an angle of <latex>\theta = 68.2^\circ</latex>. Here, <latex>v</latex> is the magnitude of the initial velocity and <latex>\theta</latex> is the angle at which the carabiner is launched, measured against the horizontal direction. If the carabiner is caught at the peak of its trajectory, what is the horizontal distance, <latex>d</latex>, between the two climbers?  

      Round your answer to 1 decimal place

        value: 8.0

        general: |
          ### Solving for the Horizontal Distance 

          This problem asks for the horizontal distance (<latex>d</latex>) the carabiner travels. To find this, calculate how long it is in the air and how far it moves horizontally.  

          **Step 1: Find the Initial Velocity Components**  
          Use trigonometry:  
          * <latex>v_{0x} = v \cos(\theta)</latex>  
          * <latex>v_{0y} = v \sin(\theta)</latex>  

          **Step 2: Find the Time of Flight to the Peak**  
          At the peak, <latex>v_y = 0</latex>. Using <latex>v_y = v_{0y} + at</latex>, solve for time <latex>t</latex> with <latex>a = -g</latex>.  

          **Step 3: Calculate the Horizontal Distance (<latex>d</latex>)**  
          Since horizontal velocity is constant,  
          <latex>d = v_{0x} \times t</latex>.  

          Substituting values gives a horizontal distance of about **8.0 m**.

The horizontal velocity of the ring as it lands on the shelf is <latex>v_x = 2.56 \text{ m/s}</latex>. Here, <b><latex>h</latex> is the vertical height</b> of the shelf, and <b><latex>v_x</latex> is the horizontal velocity</b> at which the ring reaches the shelf. What is the magnitude of the ring's initial launch velocity, <latex>v</latex>?  

      Round your answer to 1 decimal place
    answer:
        value: 8.1
        margin_type: percent
        tolerance: 3
    feedback:
        general: |
          Step 1: Analyze the Goal
          The magnitude of the initial velocity, <latex>v</latex>, is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by its initial horizontal (<latex>v_{0x}</latex>) and vertical (<latex>v_{0y}</latex>) components.  
          <latex>v = \sqrt{v_{0x}^2 + v_{0y}^2}</latex>  

          Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components
          The ring is caught at the <b>top of its trajectory</b>, so <latex>v_y = 0</latex>.  
          * <b>Initial Horizontal Velocity (<latex>v_{0x}</latex>):</b> constant, so <latex>v_{0x} = v_x = 2.56 \text{ m/s}</latex>.  
          * <b>Initial Vertical Velocity (<latex>v_{0y}</latex>):</b> use <latex>v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y</latex> with <latex>v_y=0</latex>, <latex>\Delta y = h</latex>, and <latex>a=-g</latex>.  

          Step 3: Combine the Components
          Substitute <latex>v_{0x}</latex> and <latex>v_{0y}</latex> into the Pythagorean theorem.  
          This yields a launch velocity of about **8.1 m/s**.

          Step 1: Analyze the Motion
          Motion separates into horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (constant acceleration, <latex>-g</latex>). At the <b>peak of its flight</b>, the vertical velocity is zero (<latex>v_y=0</latex>).  

          Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components
          * <b>Initial Horizontal Velocity (<latex>v_{0x}</latex>):</b> since no horizontal acceleration, <latex>v_{0x} = v_x = 6.26 \text{ m/s}</latex>.  
          * <b>Initial Vertical Velocity (<latex>v_{0y}</latex>):</b> use <latex>v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y</latex> with <latex>v_y=0</latex>, <latex>\Delta y = h</latex>, and <latex>a=-g</latex>.  

          Step 3: Calculate the Launch Angle (<latex>\theta</latex>)
          Once <latex>v_{0x}</latex> and <latex>v_{0y}</latex> are known,  
          <latex>\tan(\theta) = \frac{v_{0y}}{v_{0x}}</latex>.  
          Take the inverse tangent to find the angle, which is about **56.3°**.

The package is thrown with an initial velocity of <latex>v = 12.4 \text{ m/s}</latex> at an angle of <latex>\theta = 70.3^\circ</latex>. For this scenario, <b><latex>v</latex> is the magnitude of the initial velocity</b>, and <b><latex>\theta</latex> is the angle at which the package is launched</b>, measured against the horizontal direction. If the colleague catches the package at the peak of its trajectory, what is the horizontal distance, <latex>d</latex>, between the courier and the balcony?

          #### Step 1: Find the Initial Velocity Components
          You are given <latex>v = 12.4 \text{ m/s}</latex> and <latex>\theta = 70.3^\circ</latex>.  
          Use trigonometry:  
          * <b>Horizontal component:</b> <latex>v_{0x} = v \cos(\theta)</latex>  
          * <b>Vertical component:</b> <latex>v_{0y} = v \sin(\theta)</latex>  

          #### Step 2: Find the Time of Flight to the Peak
          At the <b>top of the trajectory</b>, the vertical velocity becomes zero (<latex>v_y = 0</latex>).  
          Using <latex>v_y = v_{0y} + at</latex> with <latex>a = -g</latex>, solve for the time <latex>t</latex> to reach the peak.  

          #### Step 3: Calculate the Horizontal Distance (<latex>d</latex>)
          Since horizontal velocity is constant,  
          <latex>d = v_{0x} \times t</latex>.  

          Substituting the values gives a horizontal distance of about **5.0 m**.

          1. **Analyze the Components of Motion:** First, break down the tennis ball's motion into two independent parts: horizontal (x-direction) and vertical (y-direction). The horizontal velocity <latex>v_x</latex> remains constant. The vertical motion starts with <latex>v_{y,0} = 0</latex> and accelerates downwards due to gravity (<latex>a_y = -g \approx -9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2</latex>).

          2. **Find the Time of Flight (t):** The time the ball is in the air is determined by its vertical motion. Use the kinematic equation <latex>\Delta y = v_{y,0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_y t^2</latex>, where <latex>\Delta y = -h</latex>, to solve for the time, <latex>t</latex>.

          3. **Find the Final Vertical Velocity (<latex>v_y</latex>):** With the time of flight, calculate the ball's final vertical velocity component using the equation <latex>v_y = v_{y,0} + a_y t</latex>.

          4. **Combine the Velocity Components:** The final velocity magnitude, <latex>v</latex>, is the vector sum of its components. Since the horizontal and vertical components are perpendicular, use the Pythagorean theorem: <latex>v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}</latex>.
