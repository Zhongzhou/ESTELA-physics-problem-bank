# Solutions

**Step-by-step solution for Problem 1 (keychain to balcony)**

1. **Model the motion:** The keychain reaches the balcony at the highest point of its path. Treat the motion as projectile motion with launch speed $v$ at angle $\theta$ above the horizontal, with negligible air resistance and constant $g$.

2. **Time to the top:** The time to reach the highest point is

$$
t_{\text{top}}=\frac{v\sin\theta}{g}.
$$

3. **Horizontal speed:** The horizontal component of the launch speed is constant,

$$
v_x = v\cos\theta.
$$

4. **Horizontal distance to the balcony:** Multiply horizontal speed by time to the top:

$$
d = v_x\, t_{\text{top}} = (v\cos\theta)\left(\frac{v\sin\theta}{g}\right)
= \frac{v^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g}
= \frac{v^2\sin(2\theta)}{2g}.
$$

5. **Evaluate with the given values:** Using $v=14.0\ \text{m/s}$, $\theta=71.6^\circ$, and $g=9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$, this yields the horizontal distance from the student to the friend on the balcony.

**Answer:** $6.0\ \text{m}$

**Step-by-step solution for Problem 2 (soccer ball to stadium banner)**

1. **Model the motion:** The banner is reached at the top of the ball’s flight. Treat this as projectile motion with constant horizontal speed $v_x$ and constant gravitational acceleration $g$.

2. **Relate height to the vertical launch component:** The vertical rise from launch to the top is $h$. For projectile motion, the vertical launch component satisfies

$$
h=\frac{(v_y)^2}{2g}\quad\Rightarrow\quad v_y=\sqrt{2gh}.
$$

3. **Combine components to get the launch speed:** The launch speed $v$ is found from the Pythagorean combination of horizontal and vertical components:

$$
v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}=\sqrt{v_x^2+2gh}.
$$

4. **Substitute the given values:** Use $h=12.0\ \text{m}$, $v_x=9.59\ \text{m/s}$, and $g=9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ to evaluate $v$.

**Answer:** $18.1\ \text{m/s}$

**Step-by-step solution for Problem 3 (wrench to scaffolding)**

1. **Model the motion:** The wrench reaches the scaffolding at the top of its flight. Use projectile motion with constant horizontal speed $v_x$ and constant gravitational acceleration $g$.

2. **Relate height to the vertical launch component:** The scaffolding is at height $h$. The vertical launch component satisfies

$$
h=\frac{(v_y)^2}{2g}\quad\Rightarrow\quad v_y=\sqrt{2gh}.
$$

3. **Combine components to get the launch speed:** The launch speed $v$ is the magnitude formed by horizontal and vertical components:

$$
v=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2}=\sqrt{v_x^2+2gh}.
$$

4. **Substitute the given values:** Use $h=8.0\ \text{m}$, $v_x=4.23\ \text{m/s}$, and $g=9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ to evaluate $v$.

**Answer:** $13.0\ \text{m/s}$

**Step-by-step solution for Problem 4 (basketball to a target above the hoop)**

1. **Model the motion:** The ball reaches the wall target at the very top of its path. Treat this as projectile motion with launch speed $v$ at angle $\theta$ and constant acceleration $g$.

2. **Time to the top:** The time to reach the top is $t_{\text{top}}=\dfrac{v\sin\theta}{g}$.

3. **Horizontal speed:** The horizontal component of the launch speed is constant: $v_x=v\cos\theta$.

4. **Horizontal distance to the target:** Multiply horizontal speed by time to the top:

$$
d=v_x\,t_{\text{top}}=(v\cos\theta)\left(\frac{v\sin\theta}{g}\right)
=\frac{v^2\sin\theta\cos\theta}{g}
=\frac{v^2\sin(2\theta)}{2g}.
$$

5. **Evaluate with the given values:** Use $v=9.58\ \text{m/s}$, $\theta=71.0^\circ$, and $g=9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ to obtain the horizontal distance from the player to the target.

**Answer:** $3.0\ \text{m}$

**Step-by-step solution for Problem 5 (toy airplane to a playground ledge)**

1. **Model the motion:** The airplane reaches the ledge at the top of its trajectory. The horizontal velocity at the ledge is the same as at launch and is given as $v_x$. Gravity is $g$.

2. **Find the vertical launch component:** The rise to the top equals the launch vertical energy contribution, so

$$
h=\frac{(v_y)^2}{2g}\quad\Rightarrow\quad v_y=\sqrt{2gh}.
$$

3. **Relate launch angle to components:** The launch angle satisfies $\tan\theta=\dfrac{v_y}{v_x}$. Here, for “up” problems, $v_x$ is the horizontal velocity when the airplane reaches the ledge (which equals its horizontal launch component).

4. **Evaluate the angle:** Substitute $h=5.0\ \text{m}$ into $v_y=\sqrt{2gh}$, then use $\theta=\arctan\!\left(\dfrac{v_y}{v_x}\right)$ with $v_x=5.57\ \text{m/s}$.

**Answer:** $67.3^\circ$
