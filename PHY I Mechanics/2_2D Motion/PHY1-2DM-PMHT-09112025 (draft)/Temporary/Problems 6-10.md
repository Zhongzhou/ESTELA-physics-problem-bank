# Solutions

## Solution 6

### Solving for the Launch Angle 

This problem asks for the initial launch angle ($\theta$) of the water bottle. We can find it by determining the initial horizontal ($v_{0x}$) and vertical ($v_{0y}$) components of the velocity and using trigonometry.

***

## Step 1: Analyze the Motion

First, we break the problem into two parts: **horizontal motion** and **vertical motion**.
* In the **horizontal direction**, there is no acceleration, so the velocity ($v_x$) is constant.
* In the **vertical direction**, the bottle is affected by gravity, so it has a constant downward acceleration, $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$.

A key piece of information is that the water bottle is caught at the **top of its trajectory**. At the very peak of its flight, the vertical velocity of an object is momentarily zero ($v_y = 0$ m/s).

***

## Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components

We need to find the velocity components at the moment the bottle was tossed.
* **Initial Horizontal Velocity ($v_{0x}$):** Because the horizontal velocity is constant, the initial horizontal velocity is the same as the velocity at the end point. You are given the horizontal velocity at which the bottle is caught ($v_x$), so you already know the initial horizontal velocity, $v_{0x}$.
* **Initial Vertical Velocity ($v_{0y}$):** We can find the initial vertical velocity using a kinematic equation. We know the final vertical velocity ($v_y=0$), the vertical displacement (the height $h$), and the acceleration due to gravity ($-g$). Using the relationship $v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y$, we can solve for the initial vertical velocity, $v_{0y}$.

***

## Step 3: Calculate the Launch Angle ($\theta$)

Now that you have both the initial horizontal velocity ($v_{0x}$) and the initial vertical velocity ($v_{0y}$), you can visualize them as the two legs of a right triangle. The launch angle $\theta$ is the angle between the horizontal component and the hypotenuse.



The relationship between these components and the angle is given by the tangent function:
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{v_{0y}}{v_{0x}}$$
To find the angle itself, you can use the inverse tangent function ($\arctan$ or $\tan^{-1}$) with the values you found in Step 2. This will give you the final answer!

## Solution 7

### Solving for the Horizontal Distance 

This problem asks for the horizontal distance ($d$) the carabiner travels. To find this, you'll need to calculate how long it's in the air and how fast it's moving horizontally. The key is to break the initial velocity into its horizontal and vertical components.

***

## Step 1: Find the Initial Velocity Components

The carabiner is thrown with an initial velocity ($v$) at a specific angle ($\theta$). The first step is to use trigonometry to find the **initial horizontal velocity ($v_{0x}$)** and the **initial vertical velocity ($v_{0y}$)**. These two components form a right triangle with the initial velocity vector as the hypotenuse.



* The horizontal component is found using: $v_{0x} = v \cos(\theta)$
* The vertical component is found using: $v_{0y} = v \sin(\theta)$

***

## Step 2: Find the Time of Flight to the Peak

Next, you need to find out how long the carabiner is in the air before it's caught. The problem states it's caught at the **peak of its trajectory**, where its vertical velocity momentarily becomes zero ($v_y = 0$).

Using the information for the vertical motion, you know the initial vertical velocity ($v_{0y}$), the final vertical velocity ($v_y=0$), and the acceleration due to gravity ($-g$). With these values, you can use the kinematic equation $v_y = v_{0y} + at$ to solve for the **time ($t$)** it takes to reach the peak.

***

## Step 3: Calculate the Horizontal Distance ($d$)

Finally, you can find the horizontal distance. In projectile motion, the **horizontal velocity is constant** because there is no horizontal acceleration. Therefore, the horizontal distance is simply the constant horizontal velocity multiplied by the time the object is in the air.

Using the horizontal velocity ($v_{0x}$) from Step 1 and the time ($t$) from Step 2, you can calculate the distance $d$:
$$d = v_{0x} \times t$$
This calculation will give you the final answer for how far the carabiner traveled horizontally.

## Solution 8

#### Step 1: Analyze the Goal
The magnitude of the initial velocity, $v$, is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by its initial horizontal ($v_{0x}$) and vertical ($v_{0y}$) components.  The relationship is:
$$v = \sqrt{v_{0x}^2 + v_{0y}^2}$$
To solve the problem, we first need to find the values for $v_{0x}$ and $v_{0y}$.

#### Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components
The problem states the ring is caught at the **top of its trajectory**, which means its final vertical velocity is momentarily zero ($v_y = 0$).
* **Initial Horizontal Velocity ($v_{0x}$):** In projectile motion, horizontal velocity is constant.  Therefore, the initial horizontal velocity is equal to the horizontal velocity given when the ring reaches the shelf ($v_x = 2.56$ m/s) .
* **Initial Vertical Velocity ($v_{0y}$):** You can find this using a kinematic equation for vertical motion.  You know the final vertical velocity ($v_y=0$), the vertical displacement ($h = 3.0$ m) , and the acceleration due to gravity ($-g$). The formula $v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y$ allows you to solve for the initial vertical speed, $v_{0y}$.

#### Step 3: Combine the Components
With both $v_{0x}$ and $v_{0y}$ determined, you can now plug them into the Pythagorean theorem from Step 1. This will combine them into a single resultant vector and give you the magnitude of the initial launch velocity, $v$.

### Solution 9

For this tennis lob, the goal is to find the **launch angle ($\theta$)**. This angle is determined by the ratio of the initial vertical velocity to the initial horizontal velocity.

#### Step 1: Analyze the Motion
First, remember that the motion is separated into two independent components: horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (constant acceleration, $-g$). The crucial information is that the ball hits the target at the **peak of its flight**, where its vertical velocity ($v_y$) is 0 m/s.

#### Step 2: Find the Initial Velocity Components
To find the angle, you first need the initial velocity components, $v_{0x}$ and $v_{0y}$.
*  **Initial Horizontal Velocity ($v_{0x}$):** Because there is no horizontal acceleration, the initial horizontal velocity is the same as the final horizontal velocity at the target ($v_x = 6.26$ m/s) .
* **Initial Vertical Velocity ($v_{0y}$):** You can find the initial vertical velocity using the information from the vertical motion.  You know the final vertical velocity ($v_y=0$), the vertical displacement ($h = 4.5$ m) , and acceleration ($-g$). Use the kinematic equation $v_y^2 = v_{0y}^2 + 2a\Delta y$ to solve for $v_{0y}$.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Launch Angle ($\theta$)
Once you have both initial components, you can find the angle using the tangent function, which relates the angle of a right triangle to its opposite and adjacent sides.
$$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{v_{0y}}{v_{0x}}$$
Using the inverse tangent function ($\arctan$ or $\tan^{-1}$) on the ratio of your calculated components will give you the launch angle, $\theta$.

### Solution 10

The task here is to find the **horizontal distance ($d$)** between the courier and the balcony. This requires finding the time the package is in the air and its constant horizontal speed.

#### Step 1: Find the Initial Velocity Components
 You are given the magnitude of the initial velocity ($v = 12.4$ m/s) and the launch angle ($\theta = 70.3$ degrees). The first step is to break this down into its initial horizontal ($v_{0x}$) and vertical ($v_{0y}$) components using trigonometry.
* Horizontal Component: $v_{0x} = v \cos(\theta)$
* Vertical Component: $v_{0y} = v \sin(\theta)$

#### Step 2: Find the Time of Flight to the Peak
To calculate the distance traveled, you must first know how long the package was in the air. The problem states it was caught at the **peak of its trajectory**, where its final vertical velocity is zero ($v_y = 0$). You can find the time ($t$) it takes to reach this point using the vertical motion data: you know the initial vertical velocity ($v_{0y}$), the final vertical velocity ($v_y$), and the acceleration ($-g$). The formula $v_y = v_{0y} + at$ is perfect for solving for $t$.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Horizontal Distance ($d$)
Finally, you can calculate the horizontal distance. Since horizontal velocity is constant, the distance is simply this velocity multiplied by the time of flight. Using the horizontal velocity ($v_{0x}$) from Step 1 and the time ($t$) from Step 2, you can find the distance:
$$d = v_{0x} \times t$$
This calculation will give you the final answer for the horizontal distance traveled by the package.
