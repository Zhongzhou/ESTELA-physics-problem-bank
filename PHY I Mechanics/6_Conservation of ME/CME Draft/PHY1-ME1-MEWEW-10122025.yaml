    description: |-
      This problem bank contains problems that belong to four variations: 
        1. an object being dropped from a height into a viscous liquid, airbag, or thick soft material, or deploys a parashoot, rocket or booster, where the object experiences some resistance or upward force, which can be approximated as constant.
        2. an object of mass m being launched up a ramp with  initial velocity v. The object experience some resistance going up the ramp for a length of d and height of h.
        3. an object being launched horizontally from a spring, or a mechanism that can be modeled as an ideal spring such as a bow or a sling shot. The object experiences constant non-conservative resistance such water resistance or a rough track, and reaches some velocity after traveling for a little distance after being launched.
        4. an object traveling with some initial velocity on a rough track or in some dense fluid such as oil or water, or experience significant air resistance for a distance, before being slowed down by a spring, or a spring like object that can be modeled as a spring such as a rubber band or elastic net. The object experiences constant non-conservative resistance during the process, and compresses/extends the spring or rubber band for a distance before coming to a stop.

            I would like to create physics problems involving work and mechanical energy. Those problems will consist of problem situations, involving an object being dropped from a height into a viscous liquid, airbag, or thick soft material, or deploys a parashoot, rocket or booster, where the object experiences some resistance or upward force, which can be approximated as constant. The object shouldn't be subjected to air resistance, nor should it hit solid material such as snow or mud.
            The problems will give mass m, drop height h, depth (or additional drop) d, resistant force f, and ask for the velocity of the object at depth d.

        - prompt 1: |
            I would like to create physics problems involving work and mechanical energy. Those problems will consist of problem situations, involving an object of mass m being launched up a ramp with  initial velocity v. The object experience some resistance going up the ramp for a length of d and height of h. Each problem will involve a different scenario.

    title: The Viscous Fluid Problem
    points: 3
    text: |
      A small steel sphere is released from rest a short distance above a deep vat of thick, viscous oil. The sphere falls through the air, enters the oil, and begins to sink. A combination of the oil's drag and buoyancy creates a constant upward resistive force on the sphere as it moves downward.
      

      Given: The sphere's mass is 0.05 kg, it is dropped from an initial height of 0.5 m above the oil, and it sinks to a depth of 0.3 m. The upward resistive force is 0.4 N.
      
      What is the sphere's final velocity (<latex>v_f</latex>) at this depth in m/s? Report your answer to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 3.3 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        This problem involves both a conservative force (gravity) and a non-conservative force (the resistive force from the oil). The change in the sphere's mechanical energy (<latex>E_{mech}</latex>) is equal to the work done by the non-conservative resistive force (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>). The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_{g,f} - U_{g,i})
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States:** Initial (i) is the sphere at rest at height <latex>h</latex>. Final (f) is the sphere at depth <latex>d</latex> in the oil.
        2.  **Set Reference Level:** Let the final position be the zero-point for gravitational potential energy (<latex>y_f = 0</latex>). This means the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        3.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        4.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute these terms back into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Rearranging the equation to solve for the final velocity, <latex>v_f</latex>, gives the general symbolic solution:
            <latex>
            v_f = \sqrt{2g(h+d) - \frac{2fd}{m}}
            </latex>

      on_incorrect: Not quite. Check your application of the work-energy theorem.

    title: The Airbag Test Problem

    text: |
      In a safety test, a crash-test dummy is dropped from a set height to simulate the physics of a collision. It lands squarely on a large airbag, which applies a constant upward force to slow the dummy's descent as it compresses. We want to determine the force the airbag provides.

      Given: The dummy has a mass of 78 kg and is dropped from a height of 2.0 m. The airbag compresses by a distance of 0.4 m, at which point the dummy's velocity is 3.34 m/s.
      
      What is the constant upward force (<latex>f</latex>) exerted by the airbag in Newtons? Report your answer to two significant figures using scientific notation if needed (e.g., 1.2e3).

    answer:
      value: 3500 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The upward force from the airbag is a non-conservative force. The work it does (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) is equal to the total change in the dummy's mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech} = \Delta K + \Delta U_g</latex>). The relationship is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_{g,f} - U_{g,i})
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the dummy at rest at height <latex>h</latex>. Final (f) is the dummy after compressing the airbag by <latex>d</latex>. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute the terms into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Now, rearrange the formula to solve for the unknown force, <latex>f</latex>:
            <latex>
            f = \frac{mg(h+d) - \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2}{d}
            </latex>
      on_correct: Excellent!
      on_incorrect: Please try again. Ensure you've correctly isolated the force variable.

    text: |
      A supply package is released from a helicopter high above the ground. It free-falls for a time, after which its parachute deploys. The parachute provides a steady upward drag force as the package continues its descent toward a landing zone.

      Given: The package has a mass of 25 kg. The parachute provides an upward force of 200 N. After the parachute opens, the package descends an additional distance of 20 m, reaching a final velocity of 32.43 m/s.
      
      From what initial height (<latex>h</latex>) did the package free-fall before the parachute opened? Report your answer in meters to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 50 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The parachute provides a non-conservative drag force. We can find the initial height by relating the work done by this force (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) to the package's total change in mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech}</latex>). The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech}
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the package at rest at the start of its free-fall. Final (f) is the package after its parachute descent. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            To find the initial free-fall height, <latex>h</latex>, rearrange the formula:
            <latex>
            h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + fd}{mg} - d
            </latex>
      on_correct: Correct!
      on_incorrect: That's not it. Re-check your algebraic rearrangement for h.

      Engineers are testing a magnetic braking system designed for a vertical drop tower. A heavy test payload is released from rest. After falling for a specific distance, the magnetic brakes engage, applying a strong, constant upward force to slow the payload.

      Given: The payload has a mass of 500 kg and free-falls for a height of 10 m. The braking system applies an upward force of 15,000 N, and the payload's final velocity is 8.65 m/s.
      
      For what distance (<latex>d</latex>) did the braking system operate? Report your answer in meters to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 3.0
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The magnetic braking system exerts a non-conservative force, doing negative work on the payload. We relate this work (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) to the total change in the payload's mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech}</latex>).
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech}
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the payload at rest at the top. Final (f) is after the braking phase. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute the terms:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Solving for the braking distance, <latex>d</latex>, requires careful algebra:
            <latex>
            d = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mgh}{mg - f}
            </latex>
      on_correct: That's correct!
      on_incorrect: Give it another try. Pay close attention when isolating the variable d.

      Given: The performer falls from a height of 15 m. The mat compresses by a distance of 1.5 m while providing an upward force of 5000 N. The performer's velocity at this point of compression is 11.66 m/s.
      
      What is the performer's mass (<latex>m</latex>)? Report your answer in kg to two significant figures.

    title: The Toy Car's Launch Speed

    text: |
      A small toy car travels up a plastic ramp and is observed to be moving at a certain speed when it reaches the top. To achieve this, it must have been launched with a sufficient initial speed at the bottom.

      Given the following information, determine the initial launch speed of the car.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 0.2 kg</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 1.39 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 0.8 m</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Height (h):</b> 0.3 m</li>
        <li><b>Frictional Force (f):</b> 0.15 N</li>
      </ul>
      What was the initial velocity (v_0) of the toy car? Provide your answer in m/s with two significant figures.
    answer:
      value: 3.0

      general: |
        To solve this, we use the principle that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) causes the change in the car's total <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech = K + U_g). The work done by the non-conservative friction force is given by W_f = -fl.

        The relationship is expressed as:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        We can substitute the specific energy terms for the car at the top and bottom of the ramp:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Now, we just need to algebraically solve for the <b>initial velocity, v_0</b>:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh + fl
        </latex>
        Multiplying by 2/m and taking the square root gives the final symbolic answer:
        <latex>
        v_0 = \sqrt{v_f^2 + 2gh + \frac{2fl}{m}}
        </latex>

    title: The Skateboard Ramp's Height
    points: 3
    text: |
      A teenager with their skateboard starts from the bottom of a concrete skate ramp and coasts upwards. Their speed decreases due to both gravity and rolling resistance from the wheels.

      Using the data below, calculate the vertical height of the ramp.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 65 kg</li>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 7.0 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 3.99 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 4.0 m</li>
        <li><b>Rolling Resistance (f):</b> 30 N</li>
      </ul>
      What is the height (h) of the skate ramp? Provide your answer in meters with two significant figures.
    answer:
      value: 1.5
      margin_type: percent
      tolerance: 2
    feedback:
      general: |
        We'll solve this using the principle that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) accounts for the change in the skateboarder's total <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech = K + U_g). The work done by the non-conservative rolling resistance is W_f = -fl.

        The core relationship is:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Substituting the specific terms for the start and end points of the motion gives us:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Our goal is to find the <b>height, h</b>. We'll rearrange the equation to isolate the potential energy term, mgh:
        <latex>

      In a physics experiment, a wooden block is sent sliding up a wooden board. By measuring its initial and final speeds, along with the dimensions of the board, it's possible to determine the kinetic friction acting on the block. 

      From the measurements provided, find the constant force of kinetic friction that acted on the block.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 2.0 kg</li>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 6.0 m/s</li>

        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 2.5 m</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Height (h):</b> 0.75 m</li>

      general: |
        This problem is solved by recognizing that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) is the reason for the change in the block's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech). The work done by this non-conservative force is what we need to find, and it's calculated over the length of the ramp as W_f = -fl.

        We start with the work-energy relationship:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Plugging in the expressions for energy and the work done by friction, we get:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        To find the <b>frictional force, f</b>, we first solve for the total work it does, fl:
        <latex>
        fl = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right)
        </latex>
        Dividing by the ramp length, l, gives the final expression for the force:
        <latex>
        f = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - mgh}{l}
        </latex>

        The solution here hinges on the work-energy principle. The <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f = -fl) is equal to the change in the puck's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech). Since the mass, m, is a component of every energy term, we can isolate it algebraically.

        The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Let's substitute the known expressions:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        To solve for the <b>mass, m</b>, we first rearrange the equation to group all terms containing mass on one side:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mgh = fl
        </latex>
        Next, we factor out m from the left side of the equation:
        <latex>
        m\left(\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}v_f^2 - gh\right) = fl
        </latex>
        Finally, we can solve for the mass:
        <latex>
        m = \frac{fl}{\frac{1}{2}(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - gh}
        </latex>

        We can find the length of the hill by applying the work-energy principle. The negative <b>work done by the resistive force</b> (W_f = -fl) is responsible for the total change in the car's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech).

        We begin with the standard work-energy equation:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Substituting the relevant terms for energy and work gives:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Our goal is to find the <b>length, l</b>. We can start by solving for the total work term, fl:
        <latex>
        fl = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right)
        </latex>
        Now, we simply divide by the resistive force, f, to get the final expression for the length:
        <latex>
        l = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - mgh}{f}
        </latex>

      Given: The car's mass is 0.50 kg, the spring constant is 100 N/m, and the spring is initially compressed by 0.20 m. The car travels 1.5 m along the track total against a frictional force of 1.0 N.

        This problem is governed by the work-energy theorem. The initial energy stored in the spring (<latex>U_s</latex>) is converted into the car's final kinetic energy (<latex>K_f</latex>) and the work done against the non-conservative frictional force (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>).

        The initial kinetic energy (<latex>K_i</latex>) of the boat is converted into two forms: the potential energy stored in the stretched bungee net (<latex>U_s</latex>) and the energy lost to the non-conservative drag force of the water (<latex>W_{lost}</latex>). The energy balance is:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = f(d+x) + \frac{1}{2}kx^2
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Energy Balance:** Set the initial kinetic energy equal to the sum of the final potential energy and the work done by drag.
        2.  **Rearrange:** Isolate the spring potential energy term:
            <latex>
            \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - f(d+x)
            </latex>
        3.  **Solve for k:** Rearrange the formula to solve for the spring constant, <latex>k</latex>:
            <latex>
            k = \frac{2(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - f(d+x))}{x^2} = \frac{mv_0^2 - 2f(d+x)}{x^2}
            </latex>
      on_correct: Excellent!
      on_incorrect: Please try again. Double-check that you've correctly isolated the spring constant.

    title: The Goalie's Pad
    points: 3
    text: |
      A hockey puck slides at high speed toward a goalie. The goalie's leg pad, which can be modeled as a spring, absorbs the puck's impact, compressing as it brings the puck to a stop. The kinetic friction between the puck and the pad provides an additional stopping force.

      Given: The puck has a mass of 0.17 kg and an initial velocity of 15 m/s. The goalie's pad has a spring constant of 500 N/m and compresses by 0.25 m. Assume friction only acts during the compression phase.
      
      What is the constant frictional force (<latex>f</latex>) between the puck and the pad in Newtons? Report your answer to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 14

      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The puck's initial kinetic energy (<latex>K_i</latex>) is absorbed by both the spring potential energy of the pad (<latex>U_s</latex>) and the work done by the non-conservative frictional force (<latex>W_{lost}</latex>). The energy conservation equation is:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + fx
        </latex>
        (Note: Since friction only acts during compression, the distance is just <latex>x</latex>).

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Energy Balance:** The initial kinetic energy is the sum of the final potential energy and the work done by friction.
        2.  **Isolate Work:** Rearrange to solve for the work done by friction, <latex>fx</latex>:
            <latex>
            fx = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2
            </latex>
        3.  **Solve for f:** Divide by the compression distance, <latex>x</latex>, to find the frictional force, <latex>f</latex>:
            <latex>
            f = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}kx^2}{x}
            </latex>
      on_correct: Correct!
      on_incorrect: That's not it. Re-check your energy balance; the initial energy must be accounted for by the spring and friction.

    text: |
      A crate is sliding across a warehouse floor with a constant kinetic friction. It runs into a bumper spring at the end of the aisle, which compresses and brings the crate to a stop.

      Given: The crate has an initial velocity of 5.0 m/s. The kinetic friction force is 40 N. The crate slides 3.0 m before hitting the spring. The spring has a constant of 400 N/m and compresses by 0.80 m.
      
      What is the mass (<latex>m</latex>) of the crate in kg? Report your answer to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 22
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        We use the work-energy theorem. The initial kinetic energy (<latex>K_i = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2</latex>) provides the energy to do work against friction (<latex>W_{lost}</latex>) over the total distance and to compress the spring, storing potential energy (<latex>U_s</latex>).
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = f(d+x) + \frac{1}{2}kx^2
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Energy Balance:** The kinetic energy is the only initial energy term. Set it equal to the sum of the final potential energy and the total work done by friction.
        2.  **Solve for m:** The mass <latex>m</latex> is only present in the kinetic energy term. Isolate it by multiplying the entire equation by <latex>2/v_0^2</latex>.
            <latex>
            m = \frac{2(f(d+x) + \frac{1}{2}kx^2)}{v_0^2} = \frac{2f(d+x) + kx^2}{v_0^2}
            </latex>
      on_correct: That's correct!
      on_incorrect: Give it another try. Remember that mass is part of the initial kinetic energy term.

    title: The Ball in the Mud
    points: 3
    text: |
      A ball is rolling with some initial speed. It enters a 2.0 m long patch of mud, which provides a constant resistive force. At the end of the mud patch, it hits an elastic band that stretches until the ball stops. The mud's resistance continues to act on the ball as it stretches the band.

      Given: The ball has a mass of 1.0 kg and an initial velocity of 6.0 m/s. The mud exerts a resistive force of 4.0 N. The elastic band has a spring constant of 100 N/m.
      
      By how much distance (<latex>x</latex>) does the elastic band stretch? Report your answer in meters to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 0.41
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The ball's initial kinetic energy (<latex>K_i</latex>) is dissipated by the work done by the resistive force from the mud (<latex>W_{lost}</latex>) and stored as elastic potential energy in the band (<latex>U_s</latex>). This problem requires solving a quadratic equation for the stretch distance, <latex>x</latex>.
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = f(d+x) + \frac{1}{2}kx^2
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Set up Equation:** Start with the work-energy balance equation.
        2.  **Rearrange into Quadratic Form:** To solve for <latex>x</latex>, we must rearrange the equation into the standard quadratic form, <latex>Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0</latex>.
            <latex>
            (\frac{1}{2}k)x^2 + (f)x + (fd - \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2) = 0
            </latex>
        3.  **Solve:** Use the quadratic formula, <latex>x = \frac{-B \pm \sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}</latex>, and take the positive root, as it represents a physical distance.
      on_correct: You've got it! Nice work solving the quadratic.
      on_incorrect: Not quite. This problem requires setting up and solving a quadratic equation for x. Check your setup.
