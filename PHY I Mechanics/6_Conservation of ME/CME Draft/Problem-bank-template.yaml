    description: |-
      This problem bank contains problems that belong to four variations: 
        1. an object being dropped from a height into a viscous liquid, airbag, or thick soft material, or deploys a parashoot, rocket or booster, where the object experiences some resistance or upward force, which can be approximated as constant.
        2. an object of mass m being launched up a ramp with  initial velocity v. The object experience some resistance going up the ramp for a length of d and height of h.
        3. an object being launched horizontally from a spring, or a mechanism that can be modeled as an ideal spring such as a bow or a sling shot. The object experiences constant non-conservative resistance such water resistance or a rough track, and reaches some velocity after traveling for a little distance after being launched.
        4. an object traveling with some initial velocity on a rough track or in some dense fluid such as oil or water, or experience significant air resistance for a distance, before being slowed down by a spring, or a spring like object that can be modeled as a spring such as a rubber band or elastic net. The object experiences constant non-conservative resistance during the process, and compresses/extends the spring or rubber band for a distance before coming to a stop.

Those problems will consist of problem situations, involving an object being dropped from a height into a viscous liquid, airbag, or thick soft material, or deploys a parashoot, rocket or booster, where the object experiences some resistance or upward force, which can be approximated as constant. The object shouldn't be subjected to air resistance, nor should it hit solid material such as snow or mud.

    title: The Viscous Fluid Problem
    points: 3
    text: |
      A small steel sphere is released from rest a short distance above a deep vat of thick, viscous oil. The sphere falls through the air, enters the oil, and begins to sink. A combination of the oil's drag and buoyancy creates a constant upward resistive force on the sphere as it moves downward.
      

      Given: The sphere's mass is 0.05 kg, it is dropped from an initial height of 0.5 m above the oil, and it sinks to a depth of 0.3 m. The upward resistive force is 0.4 N.
      
      What is the sphere's final velocity (<latex>v_f</latex>) at this depth in m/s? Report your answer to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 3.3 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        This problem involves both a conservative force (gravity) and a non-conservative force (the resistive force from the oil). The change in the sphere's mechanical energy (<latex>E_{mech}</latex>) is equal to the work done by the non-conservative resistive force (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>). The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_{g,f} - U_{g,i})
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States:** Initial (i) is the sphere at rest at height <latex>h</latex>. Final (f) is the sphere at depth <latex>d</latex> in the oil.
        2.  **Set Reference Level:** Let the final position be the zero-point for gravitational potential energy (<latex>y_f = 0</latex>). This means the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        3.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        4.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute these terms back into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Rearranging the equation to solve for the final velocity, <latex>v_f</latex>, gives the general symbolic solution:
            <latex>
            v_f = \sqrt{2g(h+d) - \frac{2fd}{m}}
            </latex>

      on_incorrect: Not quite. Check your application of the work-energy theorem.

    title: The Airbag Test Problem

    text: |
      In a safety test, a crash-test dummy is dropped from a set height to simulate the physics of a collision. It lands squarely on a large airbag, which applies a constant upward force to slow the dummy's descent as it compresses. We want to determine the force the airbag provides.

      Given: The dummy has a mass of 78 kg and is dropped from a height of 2.0 m. The airbag compresses by a distance of 0.4 m, at which point the dummy's velocity is 3.34 m/s.
      
      What is the constant upward force (<latex>f</latex>) exerted by the airbag in Newtons? Report your answer to two significant figures using scientific notation if needed (e.g., 1.2e3).

    answer:
      value: 3500 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The upward force from the airbag is a non-conservative force. The work it does (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) is equal to the total change in the dummy's mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech} = \Delta K + \Delta U_g</latex>). The relationship is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = (K_f - K_i) + (U_{g,f} - U_{g,i})
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the dummy at rest at height <latex>h</latex>. Final (f) is the dummy after compressing the airbag by <latex>d</latex>. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute the terms into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Now, rearrange the formula to solve for the unknown force, <latex>f</latex>:
            <latex>
            f = \frac{mg(h+d) - \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2}{d}
            </latex>
      on_correct: Excellent!
      on_incorrect: Please try again. Ensure you've correctly isolated the force variable.

    text: |
      A supply package is released from a helicopter high above the ground. It free-falls for a time, after which its parachute deploys. The parachute provides a steady upward drag force as the package continues its descent toward a landing zone.

      Given: The package has a mass of 25 kg. The parachute provides an upward force of 200 N. After the parachute opens, the package descends an additional distance of 20 m, reaching a final velocity of 32.43 m/s.
      
      From what initial height (<latex>h</latex>) did the package free-fall before the parachute opened? Report your answer in meters to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 50 
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The parachute provides a non-conservative drag force. We can find the initial height by relating the work done by this force (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) to the package's total change in mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech}</latex>). The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech}
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the package at rest at the start of its free-fall. Final (f) is the package after its parachute descent. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute into the main equation:
            <latex>
            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            To find the initial free-fall height, <latex>h</latex>, rearrange the formula:
            <latex>
            h = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + fd}{mg} - d
            </latex>

      Engineers are testing a magnetic braking system designed for a vertical drop tower. A heavy test payload is released from rest. After falling for a specific distance, the magnetic brakes engage, applying a strong, constant upward force to slow the payload.

      Given: The payload has a mass of 500 kg and free-falls for a height of 10 m. The braking system applies an upward force of 15,000 N, and the payload's final velocity is 8.65 m/s.
      
      For what distance (<latex>d</latex>) did the braking system operate? Report your answer in meters to two significant figures.

    answer:
      value: 3.0
      margin_type: percent 
      tolerance: 3 
    feedback:
      general: |
        **Concept:**
        The magnetic braking system exerts a non-conservative force, doing negative work on the payload. We relate this work (<latex>W_{nc}</latex>) to the total change in the payload's mechanical energy (<latex>\Delta E_{mech}</latex>).
        <latex>
        W_{nc} = \Delta E_{mech}
        </latex>

        **Symbolic Derivation:**
        1.  **Define States & Reference:** Initial (i) is the payload at rest at the top. Final (f) is after the braking phase. Let the final position be <latex>y_f=0</latex>, so the initial height is <latex>y_i = h+d</latex>.
        2.  **Express Terms:**
            -   Work by Non-Conservative Force: <latex>W_{nc} = -f \cdot d</latex>
            -   Change in Kinetic Energy: <latex>\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0</latex>
            -   Change in Potential Energy: <latex>\Delta U_g = 0 - mg(h+d)</latex>
        3.  **Combine and Solve:** Substitute the terms:

            -fd = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mg(h+d)
            </latex>
            Solving for the braking distance, <latex>d</latex>, requires careful algebra:
            <latex>
            d = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mgh}{mg - f}

      Given: The performer falls from a height of 15 m. The mat compresses by a distance of 1.5 m while providing an upward force of 5000 N. The performer's velocity at this point of compression is 11.66 m/s.

    title: The Toy Car's Launch Speed

      A small toy car travels up a plastic ramp and is observed to be moving at a certain speed when it reaches the top. To achieve this, it must have been launched with a sufficient initial speed at the bottom.

      Given the following information, determine the initial launch speed of the car.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 0.2 kg</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 1.39 m/s</li>

        <li><b>Frictional Force (f):</b> 0.15 N</li>
      </ul>
      What was the initial velocity (v_0) of the toy car? Provide your answer in m/s with two significant figures.

      general: |
        To solve this, we use the principle that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) causes the change in the car's total <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech = K + U_g). The work done by the non-conservative friction force is given by W_f = -fl.

        The relationship is expressed as:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        We can substitute the specific energy terms for the car at the top and bottom of the ramp:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Now, we just need to algebraically solve for the <b>initial velocity, v_0</b>:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh + fl
        </latex>
        Multiplying by 2/m and taking the square root gives the final symbolic answer:
        <latex>
        v_0 = \sqrt{v_f^2 + 2gh + \frac{2fl}{m}}

    title: The Skateboard Ramp's Height
    points: 3
    text: |
      A teenager with their skateboard starts from the bottom of a concrete skate ramp and coasts upwards. Their speed decreases due to both gravity and rolling resistance from the wheels.

      Using the data below, calculate the vertical height of the ramp.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 65 kg</li>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 7.0 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 3.99 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 4.0 m</li>
        <li><b>Rolling Resistance (f):</b> 30 N</li>
      </ul>
      What is the height (h) of the skate ramp? Provide your answer in meters with two significant figures.
    answer:
      value: 1.5
      margin_type: percent
      tolerance: 2
    feedback:
      general: |
        We'll solve this using the principle that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) accounts for the change in the skateboarder's total <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech = K + U_g). The work done by the non-conservative rolling resistance is W_f = -fl.

        The core relationship is:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Substituting the specific terms for the start and end points of the motion gives us:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Our goal is to find the <b>height, h</b>. We'll rearrange the equation to isolate the potential energy term, mgh:
        <latex>
        mgh = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - fl
        </latex>

    points: 3
    text: |
      In a physics experiment, a wooden block is sent sliding up a wooden board. By measuring its initial and final speeds, along with the dimensions of the board, it's possible to determine the kinetic friction acting on the block. 

      From the measurements provided, find the constant force of kinetic friction that acted on the block.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 2.0 kg</li>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 6.0 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 3.36 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 2.5 m</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Height (h):</b> 0.75 m</li>
      </ul>
      What is the magnitude of the frictional force (f)? Provide your answer in Newtons with two significant figures.

        This problem is solved by recognizing that the <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f) is the reason for the change in the block's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech). The work done by this non-conservative force is what we need to find, and it's calculated over the length of the ramp as W_f = -fl.

        We start with the work-energy relationship:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Plugging in the expressions for energy and the work done by friction, we get:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        To find the <b>frictional force, f</b>, we first solve for the total work it does, fl:
        <latex>
        fl = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right)
        </latex>
        Dividing by the ramp length, l, gives the final expression for the force:
        <latex>
        f = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - mgh}{l}
        </latex>
      on_correct: Correct! You've successfully applied the work-energy theorem.
      on_incorrect: Try again. Make sure you correctly isolate the work done by friction.

    title: Determining an Object's Mass via Energy

    text: |
      A puck of unknown mass is shot up a long, icy ramp. The puck is subject to a small, constant frictional force. An observer records its initial and final velocities, the ramp dimensions, and the friction.

      Using this information, calculate the mass of the puck.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 20 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 14.14 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Length (l):</b> 15 m</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Height (h):</b> 3.0 m</li>
        <li><b>Frictional Force (f):</b> 0.80 N</li>
      </ul>
      What is the mass (m) of the puck? Provide your answer in kg with two significant figures.
    answer:
      value: 0.17

        The solution here hinges on the work-energy principle. The <b>work done by friction</b> (W_f = -fl) is equal to the change in the puck's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech). Since the mass, m, is a component of every energy term, we can isolate it algebraically.

        The governing equation is:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Let's substitute the known expressions:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        To solve for the <b>mass, m</b>, we first rearrange the equation to group all terms containing mass on one side:
        <latex>
        \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - mgh = fl
        </latex>
        Next, we factor out m from the left side of the equation:
        <latex>
        m\left(\frac{1}{2}v_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}v_f^2 - gh\right) = fl
        </latex>
        Finally, we can solve for the mass:
        <latex>
        m = \frac{fl}{\frac{1}{2}(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - gh}
        </latex>
      on_correct: That's it! Nice job isolating the mass variable.
      on_incorrect: Check your algebra. All terms related to mechanical energy depend on mass.

    title: Finding the Length of a Hill

      After crossing the finish line, a soapbox derby car coasts up a hill. The car's speed is reduced by the incline and a constant resistive force from its axles. The total vertical rise of the hill is known, but its slope length is not.

      Based on the data collected, determine the length of the slope the car traveled.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mass (m):</b> 100 kg</li>
        <li><b>Initial Velocity (v_0):</b> 12 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Final Velocity (v_f):</b> 4.36 m/s</li>
        <li><b>Ramp Height (h):</b> 5.0 m</li>
        <li><b>Resistive Force (f):</b> 45 N</li>
      </ul>
      What is the length (l) of the hill's slope? Provide your answer in meters with two significant figures.

      value: 30

        We can find the length of the hill by applying the work-energy principle. The negative <b>work done by the resistive force</b> (W_f = -fl) is responsible for the total change in the car's <b>mechanical energy</b> (E_mech).

        We begin with the standard work-energy equation:
        <latex>
        W_f = E_{final} - E_{initial}
        </latex>
        Substituting the relevant terms for energy and work gives:
        <latex>
        -fl = \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right) - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_0^2\right)
        </latex>
        Our goal is to find the <b>length, l</b>. We can start by solving for the total work term, fl:
        <latex>
        fl = \frac{1}{2}mv_0^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgh\right)
        </latex>
        Now, we simply divide by the resistive force, f, to get the final expression for the length:
        <latex>
        l = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m(v_0^2 - v_f^2) - mgh}{f}
        </latex>
      on_correct: Perfect! You've correctly used the energy lost to find the distance.
      on_incorrect: Take another look at the setup. Are you solving for the right variable?
