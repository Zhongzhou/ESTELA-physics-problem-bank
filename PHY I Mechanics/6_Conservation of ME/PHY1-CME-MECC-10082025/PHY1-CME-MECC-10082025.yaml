        This bank contains categorization/drag and drop problems that ask students to categorize situations based on whether mechanical energy is conserved for the system.

    learning objectives:
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: |
            I am creating physics problems that asks students about the concept of conservation of mechanical energy. First, generate a one sentence description of 5 scenarios in which only gravity does work on a moving object. Avoid objects that are far away from the surface of the earth such as satellites.
        - prompt 2: |
            Remove the statement about neglecting air resistance since it will be in the default of the general description. Then place those 5 items in a table column named "Gravity Only".
        - prompt 3: |
            Update the pinball one so that it says smooth track
        - prompt 4: |
            Now generate 5 scenarios in which only elastic force does work.
        - prompt 5: |
            In all situations, add "smooth" for "frictionless" to the surface such as "table" or "track". For the arrow situation, add "an arrow is being shot from a bow" to the description.
        - prompt 6: |
            Now come up with 5 situations in which both gravity and elastic force does work and energy is conserved.
        - prompt 7: |
            Finally, come up with 5 scenarios of uniform circular motion in which an unbalanced non-conservative force is always perpendicular to the motion.
        - prompt 8: |
            Replace the last three scenarios since they are not very familiar to students.
        - prompt 9: |
            Remove the clothes scenario, and remove the description of centripetal force in the remaining ones, only retaining the description of the scenario, don't mention the forces.
        - prompt 10: |
            Change the car scenario in to a banked curve.
        - prompt 11: |
            add "holding on to the center pole" to the 3rd situation, and add 'holding on to the rail" to the 4th situation.
        - prompt 12: |
            Great, now combine the four tables generated into a long form, with one column titled "type", containing information such as "Only Gravity" or "No Net Work", and one column containing "scenario".
        - prompt 13: |
            Now add a column named "not conserved". The column should contain situations that is modified from the ones in the first column, but make mechanical energy not conserve by involving either friction or an external pushing force to the scenario. However, for "No Net Work" category, just put "NA" since it will be a bit difficulty for students.
            The scenario should not explicitly have the word "friction" in them, and shouldn't involve language suggesting that the object slows down.
        - prompt 14: | 
                I would like to write 30 categorization problems about conservation of mechanical energy. The problems are in yaml format following the example in the templace google doc. The categories are "Only conservative forces do work so mechanical energy is conserved". "No net work is done by any forces so mechanical energy is conserved", and "Non-conservative forces did work so Mechanical energy is not conserved". The first category should have 3 - 4 answers coming from the  column in the google sheet, one (or two) from each of the first 3 types. The secondcategory should have 1 or 2 answer, coming from the "scenario" column from thelast type. The 3rd category should have either 2 or 3 answers, coming from the "not conserved" column. The total number of possible answer choices should be either 7 C1 etc.
        - prompt 15: Update the rows that have either 6 or 9 total options, and make them either 7 or 8 options.
        - prompt 16: For each of the middle 3 columns, order the items in numerical order such as "B2, B8, B13". Then check if any two rows in this table are identical.
        - prompt 17: Great. Now help me draft the problem statement, asking students to sort the choice items into the proper categories. This is for the categorization problem type for Canvas new quizzes. The statement should also say that air resistance is neglected for all scenarios except for those involving wind.
        - prompt 18: In the table above, find rows such as row 1, that has complete matching items for Category A and Category C (for example, B2, B7, B12, and C2, C7 and C12), update those rows so that the choice items don't match exactly. Tell me if there are other rows in addition to row 1 that has exact matches

        - A projectile is fired from a cannon and follows a parabolic trajectory.
        - Two carts on a smooth, level track fly apart when a compressed spring between
          them is released.
        - A child bounces up and down on a pogo stick.

        answers:
        - A car travels at a steady speed around a banked curve.
        - A passenger rides on a merry-go-round that is moving at a constant speed,
          holding on to the center pole.

        answers:
        - An apple falls from a tree, landing on a vertical spring that is submerged
          in a bucket of thick oil.
        - A compressed spring between two carts on a gravel-covered track is released,
          pushing them apart.
