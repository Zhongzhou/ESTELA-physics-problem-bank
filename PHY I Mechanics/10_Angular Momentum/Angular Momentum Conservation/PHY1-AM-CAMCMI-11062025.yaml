        - prompt 1: |
            I am writing problems about conservation of angular momentum for objects freely rotating around a fixed axis, and involving change of moment of inertia. The problems involve an object than can be modeled as a uniform thin rod or thin slab, rotating without friction around an axis located at its center. Help me think of two unique problem contexts for each of the following three situations: 
            1. a small object on the rod that can be treated as a point particle initially far away from the rotation axis moves towards the axis powered by itself. 
            2. a small object on the rod that can be treated as a point particle initially close to the rotation axis sliding away from the axis 
            3. two small objects that can be treated as two point particles with mass, being dropped or landed onto the rod. 
            The contexts could potentially involve physics experiment scenarios such as in a lab, science fiction or movie scenarios such as rotating space station antennae, or other scenarios. Create two candidate context for each scenario type.
        - prompt 2: | 
            Keep the following: situation 1: A1, B1, Situation 2: A1, A2, Situation 3: B1, A2. List the title and a one line description in a table.   
        - prompt 3: |
            For each problem context, create one set of randomly generated but context appropriate numbers for: The mass of the object and the particle(s), the length of the rod, the initial and final location of the particle (or the landing positions for the two particles), and the initial angular velocity of the rotating object. In situation 3, the positions of the two masses should not be identical.
        - prompt 4: |
            First, for each set of numbers, calculate the final angular velocity of the system. Then convert both the initial angular velocity and the final angular velocity into both frequency and period.
        - prompt 5: |
            For record keeping purposes, export the situation, the description and all the associated data into a csv file.
        - prompt 6: |
            Now write the problem bodies for the two cases under the first situation. Case 1 should give the initial frequency and ask for the final frequency of rotation, and case 2 should give the initial period and ask for the final period. Describe the frequency as "rotation per second", and the period as "takes [t] seconds to complete one rotation". The problem bodies should ask students about the final frequency/period, and ask students to round their answers to two decimal places. 
        - prompt 6.1: |
            I noticed an error in the first problem. The rod shouldn't be mounted on a turntable since the turntable will also have moment of inertia. The rod should be mounted directly on the axis.
            Update both problems. In each one, mention that the cart and drone can be treated as point particles. Also, do not explicitly mention the change in moment of inertia please.
        - prompt 7: |
            Following the same requirements, write the problem bodies for the remaining four cases.
        - prompt 8: | #uploaded both the yaml and the csv files.
            I have put all the problem bodies in the markdown file, and slightly modified them. Using the problem bodies in the markdown file, as well as the data recorded in the csv file, write those four problems according to the following yaml format:

    text: |
      A uniform thin rod of mass <latex>1.50\ \text{kg}</latex> and length <latex>1.20\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted directly on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center**, allowing it to rotate freely.  
      A small cart of mass <latex>0.30\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, moves along the rod from <latex>r_i = 0.50\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis to <latex>r_f = 0.15\ \text{m}</latex> while the system spins.  

      Initially, the rod–cart system rotates at a frequency of <latex>0.67\ \text{rotation/second}</latex>.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation**, in units of **rotations per second**, after the cart reaches its final position.  
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**

          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**  
          When no external torque acts on a rotating system, its **angular momentum** is conserved:  
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>  

          **Key Steps:**  
          1. The system consists of a **uniform thin rod** and a **cart treated as a point particle** moving along it.  
          2. The moment of inertia of the rod about its center is  
             <latex>I_{\text{rod}} = \tfrac{1}{12} M L^2</latex>,  
             and the cart contributes <latex>I_{\text{cart}} = m r^2</latex>.  
          3. As the cart moves from <latex>r_i</latex> to <latex>r_f</latex>, the total moment of inertia changes, but angular momentum remains constant.  
          4. Using conservation of angular momentum,  
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.  
          5. The final frequency follows from <latex>f_f = \omega_f / (2\pi)</latex>.  

          **Reasoning:**  
          Moving inward reduces the total moment of inertia, so the system spins faster to conserve angular momentum.  

          **Final Answer:**  
          <latex>f_f = 0.91\ \text{rotations per second}</latex>

      A long antenna array of a rotating space station can be modeled as a **uniform thin rod** of mass <latex>300\ \text{kg}</latex> and length <latex>24.0\ \text{m}</latex>, rotating freely about its center in deep space.  
      A maintenance drone of mass <latex>40\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, crawls along the array from a point <latex>r_i = 10.0\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis toward a point <latex>r_f = 3.0\ \text{m}</latex>.  

      At the start, the station **takes <latex>13.96\ \text{s}</latex> to complete one rotation**.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find how long the station **takes to complete one rotation**, in units of **seconds**, after the drone reaches the inner position.  
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**

        general: |
          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**  
          For a freely rotating system in deep space, with no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:  
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>  

          **Key Steps:**  
          1. The space station is modeled as a **uniform rod**, and the drone is treated as a **point mass** at distance <latex>r</latex> from the axis.  
          2. The total moment of inertia is  
             <latex>I = \tfrac{1}{12} M L^2 + m r^2</latex>.  
          3. As the drone moves inward, the moment of inertia decreases.  
          4. From conservation of angular momentum,  
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.  
          5. The period is related by <latex>T = 2\pi / \omega</latex>, so  
             <latex>T_f = T_i \dfrac{I_f}{I_i}</latex>.  

          **Reasoning:**  
          Because the drone moves closer to the rotation axis, the system spins faster, so the period of one rotation becomes shorter.  

          **Final Answer:**  
          <latex>T_f = 11.20\ \text{seconds}</latex>

      A uniform thin rod of mass <latex>0.60\ \text{kg}</latex> and length <latex>0.80\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and can rotate freely.  
      A small ring of mass <latex>0.080\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, is released from <latex>r_i = 0.05\ \text{m}</latex> and slides outward along the rod to <latex>r_f = 0.38\ \text{m}</latex> while the system spins.  

      Initially, the system rotates at <latex>1.04\ \text{rotation/second}</latex>.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation**, in units of **rotations per second**, after the ring reaches <latex>r_f = 0.38\ \text{m}</latex>.  
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**

          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**  
          With no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:  
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>.

          **Key Steps:**  
          1. Treat the rod and ring as a compound system:  
             <latex>I_{\text{rod}} = \tfrac{1}{12} M L^2</latex>, and the ring (point particle) contributes <latex>I_{\text{ring}} = m r^2</latex>.  
          2. Before and after the slide, compute the total moment of inertia using the appropriate <latex>r</latex> value.  
          3. Apply conservation of angular momentum to relate <latex>\omega_i</latex> and <latex>\omega_f</latex>:  
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.  
          4. Convert angular speed to frequency with <latex>f = \omega/(2\pi)</latex> to obtain the requested quantity.

          **Reasoning:**  
          As the mass slides outward, the system’s total moment of inertia increases, so the rotation rate (frequency) decreases.

          **Final Answer:**  
          <latex>f_f = 0.77\ \text{rotations per second}</latex>

      A uniform thin rod of mass <latex>0.90\ \text{kg}</latex> and length <latex>1.00\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and rotates freely.  
      A small bead of mass <latex>0.020\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, is initially at <latex>r_i = 0.08\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis and slides outward along the rod to <latex>r_f = 0.45\ \text{m}</latex> as the system spins.  

      At the start, the system **takes <latex>0.81\ \text{s}</latex> to complete one rotation**.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find how long the system **takes to complete one rotation**, in units of **seconds**, after the bead reaches <latex>r_f = 0.45\ \text{m}</latex>.  
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**

          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**  
          With no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:  
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>.

          **Key Steps:**  
          1. Model the system as a uniform rod plus a point particle (the bead):  
             <latex>I = \tfrac{1}{12} M L^2 + m r^2</latex>.  
          2. Use initial and final positions of the bead to form <latex>I_i</latex> and <latex>I_f</latex>.  
          3. From conservation of angular momentum, relate angular speeds:  
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.  
          4. Convert angular speed to **period** using <latex>T = \dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}</latex>; thus  
             <latex>T_f = T_i \dfrac{I_f}{I_i}</latex>.

          **Reasoning:**  
          Sliding outward increases the total moment of inertia, which reduces angular speed and therefore **increases** the time for one rotation (the period).

      Two supply pods—**Pod A: <latex>180\ \text{kg}</latex>** and **Pod B: <latex>160\ \text{kg}</latex>**—each of which can be treated as a point particle, approach gradually and attach at fixed locations on opposite sides of the center: <latex>r_A = +12.0\ \text{m}</latex> and <latex>r_B = -9.0\ \text{m}</latex>.  

      Initially, the station **takes <latex>10.47\ \text{s}</latex> to complete one rotation**.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine how long the station **takes to complete one rotation**, in units of **seconds**, after both pods have attached.

          2. Before docking, the total is just the rod; after docking, include both pods.  
          3. Apply conservation of angular momentum to relate angular speeds:  
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.  
          4. Convert between angular speed and period using <latex>T = \dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}</latex>, giving

          **Reasoning:**  
          Attaching pods far from the axis increases <latex>I</latex>, so the rotation slows and the **period increases**.

      Two small metal disks—**Disk 1: <latex>0.10\ \text{kg}</latex>** and **Disk 2: <latex>0.15\ \text{kg}</latex>**—each of which can be treated as a point particle, are dropped from above so that they stick to the bar at <latex>r_1 = +0.40\ \text{m}</latex> and <latex>r_2 = -0.45\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis.  

      Initially, the rotating bar has a frequency of <latex>0.80\ \text{rotation/second}</latex>.

          With no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:  
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>.

          **Key Steps:**  
          1. The total moment of inertia is that of the bar plus two point masses:  
             <latex>I = \tfrac{1}{12} M L^2 + m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2</latex>.  
          2. Before the disks land, only the bar contributes; afterwards, add both <latex>m_1 r_1^2</latex> and <latex>m_2 r_2^2</latex>.  
          3. Use conservation to obtain

          4. Convert to frequency with <latex>f = \dfrac{\omega}{2\pi}</latex> to get the requested value.

          **Reasoning:**

             and the cart contributes <latex>I_{\text{cart}} = m r^2</latex>.
          3. As the cart moves from <latex>r_i</latex> to <latex>r_f</latex>, the total moment of inertia changes, but angular momentum remains constant.

          2. The total moment of inertia is
             <latex>I = \tfrac{1}{2} M R^2 + m r^2</latex>.
          3. As the drone moves inward, the moment of inertia decreases.
          4. From conservation of angular momentum,
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.
          5. The period is related by <latex>T = 2\pi / \omega</latex>, so
             <latex>T_f = T_i \dfrac{I_f}{I_i}</latex>.

          **Reasoning:**
          Because the drone moves closer to the rotation axis, the system spins faster, so the period of one rotation becomes shorter.

          **Final Answer:**
          <latex>T_f = 10.26\ \text{seconds}</latex>

    title: Rotating Lab Disc with Sliding Slug
    points: 3
    text: |
      A **uniform disc** of mass <latex>0.60\ \text{kg}</latex> and radius <latex>0.40\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and can rotate freely.
      A small slug of mass <latex>0.080\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, is released from <latex>r_i = 0.05\ \text{m}</latex> and slides outward along a raised massless radial rail attached to the disc to <latex>r_f = 0.38\ \text{m}</latex> while the system spins.

      Initially, the system rotates at <latex>1.04\ \text{rotation/second}</latex>.
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation**, in units of **rotations per second**, after the slug reaches <latex>r_f = 0.38\ \text{m}</latex>.
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**

        general: |
          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**
          With no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>.

          **Key Steps:**
          1. Treat the disc and slug as a compound system:
             <latex>I_{\text{disc}} = \tfrac{1}{2} M R^2</latex>, and the slug (point particle) contributes <latex>I_{\text{slug}} = m r^2</latex>.
          2. Before and after the slide, compute the total moment of inertia using the appropriate <latex>r</latex> value.
          3. Apply conservation of angular momentum to relate <latex>\omega_i</latex> and <latex>\omega_f</latex>:
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.
          4. Convert angular speed to frequency with <latex>f = \omega/(2\pi)</latex> to obtain the requested quantity.

          **Reasoning:**
          As the slug slides outward, the system's total moment of inertia increases, so the rotation rate (frequency) decreases.

          **Final Answer:**
          <latex>f_f = 0.64\ \text{rotations per second}</latex>

    title: Sliding Puck on Rotating Disc
    points: 3
    text: |
      A **uniform disc** of mass <latex>0.90\ \text{kg}</latex> and radius <latex>0.50\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and rotates freely.
      A small puck of mass <latex>0.020\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, is initially at <latex>r_i = 0.08\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis and slides outward along a raised massless radial rail attached to the disc to <latex>r_f = 0.45\ \text{m}</latex> as the system spins.

      At the start, the system **takes <latex>0.81\ \text{s}</latex> to complete one rotation**.
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find how long the system **takes to complete one rotation**, in units of **seconds**, after the puck reaches <latex>r_f = 0.45\ \text{m}</latex>.
      **Round your answer to two decimal places.**
    answer:
        value: 0.90
        margin_type: percent
        tolerance: 3

        general: |
          **Solution:**

          **Concept:**
          With no external torque, **angular momentum is conserved**:
          <latex>I_i \omega_i = I_f \omega_f</latex>.

          **Key Steps:**
          1. Model the system as a uniform disc plus a point particle (the puck):
             <latex>I = \tfrac{1}{2} M R^2 + m r^2</latex>.
          2. Use initial and final positions of the puck to form <latex>I_i</latex> and <latex>I_f</latex>.
          3. From conservation of angular momentum, relate angular speeds:
             <latex>\omega_f = \omega_i \dfrac{I_i}{I_f}</latex>.
          4. Convert angular speed to **period** using <latex>T = \dfrac{2\pi}{\omega}</latex>; thus
             <latex>T_f = T_i \dfrac{I_f}{I_i}</latex>.

          **Reasoning:**
          Sliding outward increases the total moment of inertia, which reduces angular speed and therefore **increases** the time for one rotation (the period).

          **Final Answer:**
          <latex>T_f = 0.90\ \text{seconds}</latex>
