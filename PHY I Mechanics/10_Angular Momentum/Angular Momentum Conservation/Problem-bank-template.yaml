    generation prompts: # Those prompts were used to generate the rod rotating around center version. Modify them to generate similar problems for other shapes.
        - prompt 1: |
            I am writing problems about conservation of angular momentum for objects freely rotating around a fixed axis, and involving change of moment of inertia. The problems involve an object than can be modeled as a uniform thin rod or thin slab, rotating without friction around an axis located at its center. Help me think of two unique problem contexts for each of the following three situations: 
            1. a small object on the rod that can be treated as a point particle initially far away from the rotation axis moves towards the axis powered by itself. 
            2. a small object on the rod that can be treated as a point particle initially close to the rotation axis sliding away from the axis 
            3. two small objects that can be treated as two point particles with mass, being dropped or landed onto the rod. 
            The contexts could potentially involve physics experiment scenarios such as in a lab, science fiction or movie scenarios such as rotating space station antennae, or other scenarios. Create two candidate context for each scenario type.
        - prompt 2: | 
            Keep the following: situation 1: A1, B1, Situation 2: A1, A2, Situation 3: B1, A2. List the title and a one line description in a table.   
        - prompt 3: |
            For each problem context, create one set of randomly generated but context appropriate numbers for: The mass of the object and the particle(s), the length of the rod, the initial and final location of the particle (or the landing positions for the two particles), and the initial angular velocity of the rotating object. In situation 3, the positions of the two masses should not be identical.
        - prompt 4: |
            First, for each set of numbers, calculate the final angular velocity of the system. Then convert both the initial angular velocity and the final angular velocity into both frequency and period.
        - prompt 5: |
            For record keeping purposes, export the situation, the description and all the associated data into a csv file.
        - prompt 6: |
            Now write the problem bodies for the two cases under the first situation. Case 1 should give the initial frequency and ask for the final frequency of rotation, and case 2 should give the initial period and ask for the final period. Describe the frequency as "rotation per second", and the period as "takes [t] seconds to complete one rotation". The problem bodies should ask students about the final frequency/period, and ask students to round their answers to two decimal places. 
        - prompt 6.1: |
            I noticed an error in the first problem. The rod shouldn't be mounted on a turntable since the turntable will also have moment of inertia. The rod should be mounted directly on the axis.
            Update both problems. In each one, mention that the cart and drone can be treated as point particles. Also, do not explicitly mention the change in moment of inertia please.
        - prompt 7: |
            Following the same requirements, write the problem bodies for the remaining four cases.
        - prompt 8: | #uploaded both the yaml and the csv files.
            I have put all the problem bodies in the markdown file, and slightly modified them. Using the problem bodies in the markdown file, as well as the data recorded in the csv file, write those four problems according to the following yaml format:
        - formatting prompt: "./YAML_formatting_prompt.md" #modify as needed.

      A uniform thin rod of mass <latex>1.50\ \text{kg}</latex> and length <latex>1.20\ \text{m}</latex> is mounted directly on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center**, allowing it to rotate freely.  
      A small cart of mass <latex>0.30\ \text{kg}</latex>, which can be treated as a point particle, moves along the rod from <latex>r_i = 0.50\ \text{m}</latex> from the axis to <latex>r_f = 0.15\ \text{m}</latex> while the system spins.  

      Initially, the rod–cart system rotates at a frequency of <latex>0.67\ \text{rotation/second}</latex>.  
      Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation**, in units of **rotations per second**, after the cart reaches its final position.
