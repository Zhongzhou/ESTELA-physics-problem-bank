### **Case 1 – Rotating Air-Track Cart (frequency version, revised)**

A uniform thin rod of mass **1.50 kg** and length **1.20 m** is mounted directly on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center**, allowing it to rotate freely.
A small cart of mass **0.30 kg**, which can be treated as a point particle, moves along the rod from **0.50 m** from the axis to **0.15 m** from the axis while the system spins.

Initially, the rod–cart system rotates at a frequency of **0.67 rotation per second**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation** in units of rotations per second after the cart reaches its final position.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**

### **Case 2 – Space Station Maintenance Drone (period version, revised)**

A long antenna array of a rotating space station can be modeled as a **uniform thin rod** of mass **300 kg** and length **24.0 m**, rotating freely about its center in deep space.
A maintenance drone of mass **40 kg**, which can be treated as a point particle, crawls along the array from a point **10.0 m** from the axis toward a point **3.0 m** from the axis.

At the start, the station takes **13.96 seconds to complete one rotation**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find how long the station **takes to complete one rotation after the drone reaches the inner position**.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**

Here are the four **problem bodies** for the remaining cases, matching your formatting and wording requirements (point particles noted; no explicit mention of moment of inertia). I alternated between **frequency** and **period** styles and kept the given numbers.

### **Case 3 – Rotating Lab Arm with Sliding Mass (frequency version)**

A uniform thin rod of mass **0.60 kg** and length **0.80 m** is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and can rotate freely.
A small ring of mass **0.080 kg**, which can be treated as a point particle, is released from **0.05 m** from the axis and slides outward along the rod to **0.38 m** while the system spins.

Initially, the system rotates at **1.04 rotation per second**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine the **final frequency of rotation** after the ring reaches **0.38 m**.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**

### **Case 4 – Sliding Bead on Rotating Rod (period version)**

A uniform thin rod of mass **0.90 kg** and length **1.00 m** is mounted on a **frictionless vertical axle through its center** and rotates freely.
A small bead of mass **0.020 kg**, which can be treated as a point particle, is initially hang at **0.08 m** from the axis and slides outward along the rod to **0.45 m** as the system spins.

At the start, the system **takes 0.81 seconds to complete one rotation**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find how long the system **takes to complete one rotation after the bead reaches 0.45 m**.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**

### **Case 5 – Docking Capsules on a Rotating Station (period version)**

A rotating space station has a central structure that can be modeled as a **uniform thin rod** of mass **500 kg** and length **30.0 m**, free to rotate about its center in deep space.
Two supply pods—**Pod A: 180 kg** and **Pod B: 160 kg**—each of which can be treated as a point particle, approach gradually and attach at fixed locations on opposite sides of the center: **(r_A = +12.0\ \text{m})** and **(r_B = -9.0\ \text{m})** (measured along the rod).

Initially, the station **takes 10.47 seconds to complete one rotation**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, determine how long the station **takes to complete one rotation after both pods have attached**.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**

### **Case 6 – Rotating Bar with Falling Masses (frequency version)**

In a laboratory setup, a **uniform thin bar** of mass **0.70 kg** and length **1.10 m** rotates freely about a **frictionless vertical axle through its center**.
Two small metal disks—**Disk 1: 0.10 kg** and **Disk 2: 0.15 kg**—each of which can be treated as a point particle, are dropped from above so that they stick to the bar at **(r_1 = +0.40\ \text{m})** and **(r_2 = -0.45\ \text{m})** from the axis.

Initially, the rotating bar has a frequency of **0.80 rotation per second**.
Assuming no external torque acts on the system, find the **final frequency of rotation** after both disks have attached.
**Round your answer to two decimal places.**
