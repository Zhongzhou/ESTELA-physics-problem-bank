## Situation 1 — Carts on a Track and a Spring Bumper

### Problem Title:  
**Carts on a Track and a Spring Bumper**

### Problem Description:  
Two carts, **A** and **B**, move on a smooth, horizontal, frictionless track. Cart A is moving toward cart B, which is initially at rest. A fixed **spring bumper** is mounted at the far end of the track. Cart A collides with cart B, and the two carts **stick together** and continue moving toward the spring bumper. Afterward, the joined carts compress the spring until they momentarily come to rest before reversing direction.

For each of the following **process descriptions**, determine whether **mechanical energy** and/or **linear momentum** of the two-cart system is conserved.  
Drag each **conservation statement** onto the corresponding process description.  
**If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.**

### Process Descriptions

1. **From when carts A and B are far apart to just before the two carts collide with each other.**  
2. **From just before the carts collide with each other to just after they stick together.**  
3. **From just after the two carts stick together to the moment the joined carts are momentarily at rest while compressing the spring.**  
4. **From when cart A begins moving toward cart B until the joined carts come to rest against the spring bumper.**  
5. **From just before cart A hits cart B until the spring is fully compressed.**

### Conservation Statements

- **Both Linear Momentum and Mechanical Energy are conserved** → **Process 1**  
- **Linear Momentum is conserved but not Mechanical Energy** → **Process 2**  
- **Mechanical Energy is conserved but not Linear Momentum** → **Process 3**

### Distractor Notes  
**Processes 4 and 5** (entire sequence; collision + spring compression together) are distractors — across each entire described span, **neither mechanical energy nor linear momentum is conserved** throughout.

## Situation 2 — Ice Hockey Puck and Helmet on Ice (gravity in the energy phase)

### Problem Title:  
**Hockey Puck–Helmet on Ice, Then a Ramp**

### Problem Description:  
On a smooth, frictionless ice rink, a **hockey puck** slides toward a **helmet** that is initially at rest. A smooth, frictionless ramp stands nearby. The puck collides with the helmet, and they **stick together**. The combined puck+helmet then move up the ramp, slowing down as gravitational potential energy increases, until they momentarily come to rest before sliding back down.

For each of the following **process descriptions**, determine whether **mechanical energy** and/or **linear momentum** of the two-object system (puck + helmet) is conserved.  
Drag each **conservation statement** onto the corresponding process description.  
**If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.**

### Process Descriptions

1. **From when the puck and helmet are far apart on the ice to just before they collide with each other.**  
2. **From just before the puck hits the helmet to just after they stick together.**  
3. **From just after the puck and helmet stick together to the moment the combined object is momentarily at rest at the top of the ramp.**  
4. **From when the puck begins sliding toward the helmet until the combined object is momentarily at rest at the top of the ramp.**  
5. **From just before the puck hits the helmet until the combined object is momentarily at rest at the top of the ramp.**

### Conservation Statements

- **Both Linear Momentum and Mechanical Energy are conserved** → **Process 1**  
- **Linear Momentum is conserved but not Mechanical Energy** → **Process 2**  
- **Mechanical Energy is conserved but not Linear Momentum** → **Process 3**

### Distractor Notes  
**Processes 4 and 5** (the entire sequence; collision + gravitational phase together) are distractors — across each entire described span, **neither mechanical energy nor linear momentum is conserved** throughout.

## Situation 3 — Block Released from a Compressed Spring (elastic force in the energy phase)

### Problem Title:  
**Compressed Spring Launch and Collision**

### Problem Description:  
Block A rests against a **compressed spring** anchored to a wall on a frictionless horizontal track. The spring is released, and Block A is **accelerated by the spring** as it moves toward Block B, which is initially at rest farther down the track. After leaving the spring, Block A collides with Block B, and the two blocks **stick together**. The joined blocks then coast freely on the frictionless track, far from the wall and spring.

For each of the following **process descriptions**, determine whether **mechanical energy** and/or **linear momentum** of the two-block system (A + B) is conserved.  
Drag each **conservation statement** onto the corresponding process description.  
**If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.**

### Process Descriptions

1. **From when Block A is released and being accelerated by the compressed spring to just before it hits Block B.**  
2. **From just before Block A hits Block B to just after the two blocks stick together.**  
3. **From just after the two blocks stick together to a moment later while they are coasting far from the wall and spring on the frictionless track.**  
4. **From when Block A is released and being accelerated by the compressed spring until the joined blocks are coasting far from the wall and spring.**  
5. **From when Block A is released and being accelerated by the compressed spring to just after Blocks A and B stick together.**

### Conservation Statements

- **Mechanical Energy is conserved but not Linear Momentum** → **Process 1**  
- **Linear Momentum is conserved but not Mechanical Energy** → **Process 2**  
- **Both Linear Momentum and Mechanical Energy are conserved** → **Process 3**

### Distractor Notes  
**Processes 4 and 5** (entire sequence; spring acceleration + collision together) are distractors — across each entire described span, **neither mechanical energy nor linear momentum is conserved** throughout.

## Situation 4 — Sled Down a Hill into a Second Sled (gravity in the energy phase)

### Problem Title:  
**Sled Descends, Sticks, and Glides**

### Problem Description:  
Sled A starts from rest at the top of a smooth, frictionless hill and slides down toward Sled B, which waits at the bottom on level, frictionless ice. Sled A collides with Sled B, and they **stick together**. The joined sleds then glide across the flat ice with no additional horizontal forces acting.

For each of the following **process descriptions**, determine whether **mechanical energy** and/or **linear momentum** of the two-sled system (A + B) is conserved.  
Drag each **conservation statement** onto the corresponding process description.  
**If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.**

### Process Descriptions

1. **From when Sled A begins descending the hill to just before it collides with Sled B at the bottom.**  
2. **From just before Sled A hits Sled B to just after the two sleds stick together.**  
3. **From just after the two sleds stick together to a moment later while they glide across the level, frictionless ice.**  
4. **From when Sled A begins descending the hill until the joined sleds are gliding together across the level ice.**  
5. **From when Sled A begins descending the hill to just after the two sleds stick together.**

### Conservation Statements

- **Mechanical Energy is conserved but not Linear Momentum** → **Process 1**  
- **Linear Momentum is conserved but not Mechanical Energy** → **Process 2**  
- **Both Linear Momentum and Mechanical Energy are conserved** → **Process 3**

### Distractor Notes  
**Processes 4 and 5** (entire sequence; gravitational energy phase + collision together) are distractors — across each entire described span, **neither mechanical energy nor linear momentum is conserved** throughout.
