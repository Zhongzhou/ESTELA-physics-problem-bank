    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: |
            I would like to create physics problems involving conservation of linear momentum. I would like to find 15 situations in which one object, traveling in a straight line, either split/explodes into two pieces, or launches an object in a direction. For example: 
            a piece of firework traveling directly upwards explodes into two pieces, 
            A roller skater skating in a straight line throws a heavy backpack at an angle.
            A space-ship cruising in space launches an exploration pod
            Avoid objects that are subjected to significant air or water resistance, such as feather or parashoot, but small resistance such as a submarine is fine. The masses of the objects shouldn't be too different, for example, a skater and a backpack is fine but a skater and a ping-pong ball is too different. The launched object must be launched at an angle from the initial path of travel.
        - prompt 2: | 
            Update the above list following those requirements:
                1. The object shouldn't be restricted by a track or travel on a rail
                2. A buoy is subjected to too much external force, consider changing it into a probe or a drone.
                3. Avoid "dropping" objects that are only subjected to gravity.
        - prompt 3: |
            Remove the last three scenarios in the launching category, and add one scenario to the splitting category involving a traveling particle decaying into two sub-particles. Organize all the scenarios into a table.
        - prompt 4: |
            Remove the key physics details column and the Category column. Add the following columns:
                Object_Mass: Mass of the original object
                Object_velocity: Initial velocity of the original object
                Piece1_Mass: the mass of the first piece that is split or launched
                Piece1_x_velocity: Component of the velocity of the first piece in the same direction as the original object.
                Piece1_y_velocity: Component of the velocity of the first piece perpendicular to the original object.
                Estimate the values of all those variables for each of the given scenario. 
        - prompt 5: | # this is several prompts combined together. 
            I want scenario 6 to be in the classic realm, so the particle velocity should be in m/s, whereas the mass should be in a much smaller unit to avoid very small numbers. This is for introductory level physics students. Also, change the masses to be 10 times smaller for rows 8 and 9, and update the scenario to small submarine and small space-ship.
            Ok, let's change scenario 6 into a heavy particle undergoing alpha decay. Use a mass unit that is suitable for those particles, and make sure that the velocities are non-relativistic
            Make the y-component velocity in row 6 1000 times smaller so that it doesn't dominate the resulting particle's motion.
        - prompt 6: | # the created table is downloaded.
            I have this table that contains 12 problems involving conservation of linear momentum of an object being exploded or splitted into two pieces. the existing columns contain the initial mass and velocity of the object, the x and y component velocity of the first piece, and the mass of the first piece. Can you please write a python program that calculates the values of the following:
              mass of the second piece, x and y component velocities of the second piece, and the magnitude of the velocity of the second piece. 
            Add all those values to the table by adding four columns please
            Can you update the code so that it calculates the magnitude of the velocity of both the first piece and the second piece?
        - prompt 7: |
            Here is the resulting csv file containing all the information. Now try to write a physics problem based on the information in row 1, given the information about the original object and piece 1, asking for the magnitude of the velocity of piece 2. State in the problem that the linear momentum of the system can be seen as conserved immediately before and after the [event in the problem context]. Use \hat{i} to indicate the direction of the original velocity, and i and j to indicate the direction of the first piece.
        - prompt 8: |
            I've slightly modified problem 1 to make it read better. Now follow the same style and write a problem for row 2, this time, give the information for piece 2 and ask for the magnitude of velocity of piece 1, round all numbers to 2 decimal places after zero.
            Please append problem 2 after problem 1 in a single markdown file, and remove Piece 1 and Piece 2 from the problem text.
        - prompt 9: | # Note: may need to remove problem 2 since it contains a 0 j component velocity.
            Now write the problem bodies for rows 3-10, alternating between asking for the velocity of piece 1 and the velocity of piece 2.
        - prompt 10: |
            Now write the remaining 2 problems please
        - prompt 11: | # the markdown file is downloaded, and re-uploaded with the csv to generate solutions. This is also a combination of multiple prompts.
            I have an md file containing the problem body of 12 linear momentum conservation problems, and a csv file containing the numbers used for each problem. Please write a concise solution for problem 1, don't explicitly list the numerical calculation details. Momentum conservation needs to be applied in each direction separately.
            Make it shorter by using math expressions for the x-direction and y-direction conservation of linear momentum equations to replace the text description.
            Great, now follow the same format, and construct solutions for problems 2 and 3
            Now write problem solutions for problems 4-8, following the same template
            Now write solutions for the remaining 4 problems please.
        - prompt 12: |
            Combine all the 12 solutions into a markdown file please
        - prompt 13: | # yaml formatting prompt
            I have three files, containing problem bodies, correct numbers, and solutions of 12 physics problem. I would like you to combine the problems, the correct answers, and the solutions into a single yaml file, following yaml format following this example:
            (yaml example from template file goes here)
            The yaml file should contain all 12 problems

    title: Conservation of Momentum Exploding Shell
    points: 3
    text: |
      A <latex>10.0 \text{ kg}</latex> cannon shell is traveling with an initial velocity of <latex>\vec{V} = (300 \hat{i}) \text{ m/s}</latex> when it suddenly explodes into two fragments.
      
      Immediately after the explosion, one fragment has a mass of <latex>4.0 \text{ kg}</latex>, is observed to be moving with a velocity of <latex>\vec{v}_1 = (320 \hat{i} + 50 \hat{j}) \text{ m/s}</latex>.
      
      Assuming the linear momentum of the shell system is conserved immediately before and after the explosion, what is the magnitude of the velocity of the second fragment? Round your answer to two decimal places after zero.

        This problem is solved using the <b>principle of conservation of linear momentum</b>. The total momentum of the system before the explosion (<latex>\vec{P}_{initial}</latex>) must equal the total momentum of the two fragments after (<latex>\vec{P}_{final}</latex>).

            </ul>
        </li>

        </ol>
        <br>
        Solving these two equations gives the velocity vector for the second fragment: <latex>\vec{v}_2 = (286.67 \hat{i} - 33.33 \hat{j}) \text{ m/s}</latex>.

        <b>Solution to Problem 24</b>
        <br><br>
        This problem is solved using the <b>principle of conservation of linear momentum</b> for a perfectly inelastic collision. The total momentum of the system before the collision (<latex>\vec{P}_{initial}</latex>) must equal the total momentum of the combined object after (<latex>\vec{P}_{final}</latex>).
        <br><br>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Initial State:</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Object 1: <latex>m_1 = 100.00 \text{ kg}</latex>, <latex>\vec{v}_1 = (10.00 \hat{i}) \text{ m/s}</latex></li>
            <li>Object 2: <latex>m_2 = 80.00 \text{ kg}</latex>, <latex>\vec{v}_2 = ?</latex></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Final State:</b>
            <ul>
            <li>Combined Object: <latex>M_f = 180.00 \text{ kg}</latex>, <latex>\vec{V}_{f} = (7.00 \hat{i} + 2.00 \hat{j}) \text{ m/s}</latex></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The conservation equation <latex>m_1\vec{v}_1 + m_2\vec{v}_2 = M_f\vec{V}_{f}</latex> is applied separately to the x and y components to solve for the unknown initial velocity <latex>\vec{v}_2 = (v_{2x} \hat{i} + v_{2y} \hat{j})</latex>:
        <br><br>
        <ol>
        <li><b>X-Direction:</b> <latex>m_1 v_{1x} + m_2 v_{2x} = M_f V_{fx}</latex></li>
        <latex>(100.00)(10.00) + (80.00) v_{2x} = (180.00)(7.00) \implies v_{2x} = 3.25 \text{ m/s}</latex>
        <li><b>Y-Direction:</b> <latex>m_1 v_{1y} + m_2 v_{2y} = M_f V_{fy}</latex></li>
        <latex>(100.00)(0) + (80.00) v_{2y} = (180.00)(2.00) \implies v_{2y} = 4.50 \text{ m/s}</latex>
        </ol>
        <br>
        The velocity vector for the second object was <latex>\vec{v}_2 = (3.25 \hat{i} + 4.50 \hat{j}) \text{ m/s}</latex>.
        <br><br>
        The <b>magnitude</b> of this velocity is found using the Pythagorean theorem: <latex>|\vec{v}_2| = \sqrt{v_{2x}^2 + v_{2y}^2}</latex>.
        <br><br>
        The magnitude of the initial velocity of the second object is <b><latex>5.55 \text{ m/s}</latex></b>.
