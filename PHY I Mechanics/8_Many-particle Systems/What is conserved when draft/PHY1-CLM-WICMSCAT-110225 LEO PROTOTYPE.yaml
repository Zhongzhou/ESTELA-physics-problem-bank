    generation prompts: # Those prompts creates the 8 problems for the perfectly inelastic collision condition. Modify those prompt to create two mor sets of 8 problems for explosion/launch forward situation, and collide and bounce condition.
        - prompt 1: |
            I am writing introductory level physics problems about conservation of linear momentum and mechanical energy. Please come up with four situations, each consisting of two objects and three consecutive stages. For the first two situations, in the first stage, both mechanical energy and linear momentum of the system is conserved. In the second stage there is a perfectly inelastic collision between the two objects. In the third stage,  mechanical energy of the system is conserved since conservative force does work on the system, but linear momentum is not (alternate between gravity and elastic force for the conservative forces). For example, an inelastic ballistic pendulum in which a bullet is embedded into the pendulum is a good example.
            For the next two situations, stages 1 and 3 are reversed. For example, a block slides down a curved track and hits and sticks to a second block.
            List each of the situations and the three stages under the situation.
        - prompt 2: | 
            Now write the first situation into a categorization problem. The problem asks students to decide whether mechanical energy or linear momentum is conserved during a collision process. 
            Follow the instructions below:
            Write a problem description describing the entire process including all three stages, but do not explicitly state the stages. 
            Ask students to decide if mechanical energy and linear momentum of the system is conserved during each of the following processes, by dragging the conservation statements on to the corresponding process descriptions.
            Write five description of processes. Each description takes the form of "from....to...". For example: From when cart A and B are far apart to just before the two carts collide with each other. From just before the carts collide with each other to just before both carts hit the spring bumper.
            The first three descriptions correspond to the three stages in the situation. The last two descriptions are distractors, so neither quantity is conserved. One of them should be the entire process from start to end. The other should include both the collision phase and energy conservation phase.
            Finally, associate the following three conservation statements to the first three process descriptions: 
            Linear momentum is conserved but not Mechanical Energy
            Mechanical Energy is conserved but not Linear Momentum
            Both Linear Momentum and Mechanical Energy are conserved
        - prompt 2.1: |
            Make one small change: in 5., don't use "instant of collision", instead use "From just before Cart A hits Cart B".
        - prompt 3: |
            Following the same structure, generate the full content for situations 2-4
        - prompts 3.1: | # multiple small modification prompts.
            Make the following changes: For situation 2, change the situation into an ice-hockey puck hitting something on ice (such as an ice hockey glove or helmet) and sticking to it. For situation 3, don't use stretched spring, use compressed spring. In the first description, state when the block is released and being accelerated by the spring.
            For situation 3, update descriptions 4 and 5 according to description 1.
        - prompt 4: | # for record keeping purpose
            Now add all four complete problem texts into a downloadable markdown file.
            Add this sentence at the end of each problem description: "If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description".
        - prompt 5: | # yaml formatting example omitted, see formatting template.
            For each of the four problems in the markdown file, translate the format into yaml according to the following example:

            The categories should be the process descriptions, and the answers should be the conservation statements. For distractor processes, leave an empty answers field "answers:"
        - prompt 6: |
            Based on those four problems, generate four new problems by changing the problem text such as the process involving conservative forces doing work happens on rough surface or resistive medium. (the collision and sliding process still happens on smooth surface).  Write the four problem texts first.
        - prompt 6.1: |
            Make the following changes: Do not explicitly mention how friction or resistive force does work in each situation, only mention that the surface is rough. In situations 3 and 4, the initial stage should happen on rough surface, whereas the second process should happen on smooth surface.
        - prompt 7: |
            Yes, please convert those into yaml file with the following requirements:
            1. label the question q5 - q8
            2. The process that happens on rough surface now has an empty "answers:" field
            3. The "mechanical energy is conserved by not linear momentum" now becomes a distractor under the "distractors:" field

    title: Carts on a Track and a Spring Bumper
    points: 100
    text: |
      Two carts, A and B, move on a smooth, horizontal, frictionless track. Cart A is moving toward cart B, which is initially at rest. 
      A fixed spring bumper is mounted at the far end of the track. Cart A collides with cart B, and the two carts stick together 
      and continue moving toward the spring bumper. Afterward, the joined carts compress the spring until they momentarily come 
      to rest before reversing direction.

      For each of the following process descriptions, determine whether mechanical energy and/or linear momentum of the two-cart system 
      is conserved. Drag each conservation statement onto the corresponding process description.  
      If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.

    title: Hockey Puck–Helmet on Ice, Then a Ramp
    points: 100
    text: |
      On a smooth, frictionless ice rink, a hockey puck slides toward a helmet that is initially at rest. 
      A smooth, frictionless ramp stands nearby. The puck collides with the helmet, and they stick together. 
      The combined puck+helmet then move up the ramp, slowing down as gravitational potential energy increases, 
      until they momentarily come to rest before sliding back down.

      For each of the following process descriptions, determine whether mechanical energy and/or linear momentum of the two-object system 
      (puck + helmet) is conserved. Drag each conservation statement onto the corresponding process description.

    title: Compressed Spring Launch and Collision
    points: 100
    text: |
      Block A rests against a compressed spring anchored to a wall on a frictionless horizontal track. 
      The spring is released, and Block A is accelerated by the spring as it moves toward Block B, which is initially at rest farther down the track. 
      After leaving the spring, Block A collides with Block B, and the two blocks stick together. 
      The joined blocks then coast freely on the frictionless track, far from the wall and spring.

      For each of the following process descriptions, determine whether mechanical energy and/or linear momentum of the two-block system 
      (A + B) is conserved. Drag each conservation statement onto the corresponding process description.

      Two carts, A and B, move on a smooth, horizontal, frictionless track. Cart A is moving toward cart B, which is initially at rest. 
      A rough patch lies just before a fixed spring bumper at the far end of the track. Cart A collides with cart B, and the two carts stick together,

    title: Block Slides Down Ramp and Collides with Cart
    points: 100
    text: |
      A frictionless track starts as a ramp that slopes downward and then levels off into a horizontal section.
      Block A starts at rest at the top of the ramp. Cart B is at rest on the horizontal section of the same track.
      Block A is released and slides down the ramp, gaining speed. When Block A reaches the horizontal section,
      it collides with Cart B, and they stick together. The combined object then coasts freely along the horizontal
      section of the track. Assume no air resistance.

      For each of the following process descriptions, determine whether mechanical energy and/or linear momentum of the two-object system

    points: 100
    text: |
      A dart (A) is fired horizontally toward a wooden block (B), which hangs at rest from a long, massless string. 
      The dart collides with and embeds itself in the block. The combined dart+block then swing upward, 
      **experiencing significant air drag** until they momentarily stop at their maximum height.

      For each of the following process descriptions, determine whether mechanical energy and/or linear momentum of the two-object system 
      (dart + block) is conserved. Drag each conservation statement onto the corresponding process description.  
      If neither linear momentum nor mechanical energy is conserved, do not drag any statement onto the process description.
