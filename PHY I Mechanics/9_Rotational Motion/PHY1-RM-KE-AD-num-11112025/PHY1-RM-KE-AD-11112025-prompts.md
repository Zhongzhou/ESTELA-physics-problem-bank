For questions

-- prompt 1
Come up with 10 examples of rigid objects that undergo rotational motion and estimate realistic ranges for their angular velocities and angular acceleration. report in a table. in this chat, this will be known as table 1.

-- prompt 2
Using the data from table 2, create a word problem for each row describing a reasonable scenario in which the object undergoes some motion with constant angular acceleration. The stories should be independent for each problem and should have some detail, especially if you can think of some interesting scenario or useful application. 

In all problems, the angular displacement is an unknown to be found, and the initial velocity is specified implicitly. Two other kinematic variables are given in each problem as follows:
For the A rows: the time interval and the angular acceleration. 
For the B rows: the time interval and the final velocity, and 
For the C rows: the angular acceleration and the final velocity.

The physical quantities and their values may be implied using some keyword -- for example, using "starting from" to refer to the initial angular velocity, or "speeds up at a rate of" to refer to the acceleration, or "rest" to refer to the angular velocity being 0, and so on. 

Use "how many revolutions" to as ask about the angular displacement. Ask the student to "Provide your answer to one decimal place." 


-- for solutions
Write concise student facing solutions for all problems. Each solution should include the following elements: 1. A statement of recognition that the situation described involves rotational motion with constant angular acceleration. Contextualize this statement using language inspired from the problem statement. 2. A statement indicating that the objective is to find the angular displacement in units of revolution. 3. A list of the rotational kinematic variables relevant to this segment of motion with constant angular acceleration, indicating for each variable whether it is explicitly or implicitly given or unknown. 4. An explicit statement of the relevant kinematic equation including the relevance in the first place. 5. A step by step algebraic manipulation to find a symbolic solution to get the desired variable. 6. Substitute to find the angular displacement in radians, then convert to revolutions. Always be explicit about the units of every quantity. If you are going to use bullets, then indent for better readability.
