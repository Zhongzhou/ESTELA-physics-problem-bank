    generation prompts: # The following prompts will generate three problems for a set of three images with a different object. Lightly modify those prompts to generate sets of three questions for other configurations.
        - prompt 1: |
            Here are three pictures of three composite objects. Each object consists of a uniform thin rod of mass m_1 and length L, pivoted on the left end, an object of mass m_2 and dimension d (a square, a uniform disk, and a massive ring) attached to the other end of the rod as shown in the images. Finally, a small point mass of mass m_3 is attached to the far end of the composite object. I would like to create three multiple choice problems regarding the moment of inertia of this composite object. First, generate a symbolic expression of the moment of inertia of each object. Do not simplify the expression.
        - prompt 2: | 
            Great, now create a table with three rows. Column 1 is object type, column 2 is correct answer. Column 2 should contain the latex expression for the moment of inertia (without the explanation text under it)
        - prompt 3: |
            Now add five new columns, each column representing one distractor:
                Distractor 1: replace all the d/2 with d in each expression.
                Distractor 2: remove the parallel axis theorem term
                Distractor 3: remove the parallel axis theorem term, and change the distance of the m_3 terms into L
                Distractor 4: replace (L+d/2)^2 term in the parallel axis theorem term with L^2.
                Distractor 5: remove the parallel axis theorem term, and replace the rod about end term with rod about center (1/12mL^2) 
        - prompt 4: |
            Now draft a problem body for the first situation. The problem body should mention that the composite object is rotating around a pivot, located at one end of the rod, shown as a black dot in the figure, and a small part that can be treated as a point mass, represented as a green circular dot, located at the far end of the object. Ask students to select the correct expression for the composite object rotating around the pivot.
        - prompt 5: |
            Now generate the problem body for the other two scenarios
        - prompt 6: | #Append the standard MC format to this prompt without the feedback part. I chose to generate the feedback later to limit the length of generation at once.
            Write the problem body and choice items for each of the above three problems following the yaml format in the example below. The image file name should be the same as the file names of the uploaded images.
        - prompt 7: |
            Lastly, write a concise solution for each of the three situations above. The solution consists of the correct expression of the moment of inertia, and a short explanation of each term in the expression.
        - prompt 8: |
            Great, now amend the above yaml file by adding the following fields at the end:
            feedback:
                general: [Replace with the solution of the problem]

    title: Moment of Inertia – Square Plate Attachment
    points: 1
    text: |
        A composite object consists of a **uniform thin rod** of mass \(m_1\) and length \(L\), pivoted about its **left end** (indicated by the black dot in the figure). 
        Attached to the **right end** of the rod is a **uniform square plate** of mass \(m_2\) and side length \(d\), oriented so that one edge of the square is flush with the end of the rod. 
        Finally, a **small point mass** of mass \(m_3\) (represented by the **green circular dot**) is attached to the **far end** of the square plate.  

        The entire system rotates in a vertical plane about the pivot point at the left end of the rod.  

        Which of the following expressions correctly represents the **moment of inertia \(I\)** of this composite object about the pivot?
