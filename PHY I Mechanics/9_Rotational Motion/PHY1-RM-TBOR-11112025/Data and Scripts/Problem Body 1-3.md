A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal** position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of the rod. The rod is in **static equilibrium**. The rod’s weight is **8 N**. A block of weight **4 N** is suspended from the rod **at ( \tfrac{1}{8}L ) from the right end**.

An external force **F** is applied on the rod **at ( \tfrac{3}{4}L ) from the right end**. The force points **upward at an angle of (60^\circ)** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

Determine the **magnitude of the force (F)** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

### Concise solution

About the pivot (right end), CCW positive:
(\tau_b = 4!\left(\tfrac{1}{8}-0\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}),
(\tau_r = 8!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right)=4),
(\tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}F\big)!\left(\tfrac{3}{4}-0\right) = -\tfrac{3}{8}F).
Equilibrium: (\tfrac{1}{2}+4-\tfrac{3}{8}F=0 \Rightarrow F=12\ \text{N}).
**Answer:** **12 N**.

A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal** position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of the rod. The rod is in **static equilibrium**. A block of weight **8 N** is suspended from the rod **at ( \tfrac{1}{8}L ) from the right end**.

An external force of magnitude **18 N** is applied on the rod **at the left end** (i.e., **at (1\cdot L)** from the right end). The force points **upward at an angle of (60^\circ)** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

Determine the **weight of the rod** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

### Concise solution

About the pivot (right end), CCW positive:
(\tau_b = 8!\left(\tfrac{1}{8}-0\right)=1),
(\tau_r = W_r!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}W_r),
(\tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot 18\big)!(1-0) = -9).
Equilibrium: (1+\tfrac{1}{2}W_r-9=0 \Rightarrow \tfrac{1}{2}W_r=8 \Rightarrow W_r=16\ \text{N}).
**Answer:** **16 N**.

A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal** position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of the rod. The rod is in **static equilibrium**. The rod’s weight is **32 N**.

An external force of magnitude **53.33 N** is applied on the rod **at ( \tfrac{3}{4}L ) from the right end**. The force points **upward at an angle of (60^\circ)** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. A block is attached **at ( \tfrac{1}{4}L ) from the right end**. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

Determine the **weight of the block** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

### Concise solution

About the pivot (right end), CCW positive:
(\tau_b = W_b!\left(\tfrac{1}{4}-0\right)=\tfrac{1}{4}W_b),
(\tau_r = 32!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right)=16),
(\tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot 53.33\big)!\left(\tfrac{3}{4}-0\right) \approx -20.00).
Equilibrium: (\tfrac{1}{4}W_b + 16 - 20 = 0 \Rightarrow \tfrac{1}{4}W_b = 4 \Rightarrow W_b = 16\ \text{N}).
**Answer:** **16 N**.
