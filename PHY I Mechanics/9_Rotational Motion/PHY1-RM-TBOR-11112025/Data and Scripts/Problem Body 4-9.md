### Problem 4 (Unknown F)

A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal** position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of the rod. The rod is in **static equilibrium**. The rod’s weight is **4 N**. A block of weight **32 N** is suspended from the rod **at <latex>\tfrac{1}{4}L</latex> from the right end**.

An external force **F** is applied on the rod **at the left end**. The force points **upward at an angle of <latex>60^\circ</latex>** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

Determine the **magnitude of the force <latex>F</latex>** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

**Concise solution**
About the pivot (right end), CCW positive: <latex>
\tau_b = 32!\left(\tfrac{1}{4}-0\right)=8,\quad
\tau_r = 4!\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right)=2,\quad
\tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}F\big)!(1-0)=-\tfrac{1}{2}F. </latex>
Equilibrium: <latex>8+2-\tfrac{1}{2}F=0 \Rightarrow F=20~\text{N}</latex>.
