    title: Static Equilibrium of a Horizontal Rod – Force Determination
    points: 1 
    text: |
      A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal** position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of the rod. The rod is in **static equilibrium**. The rod’s weight is **8 N**. A block of weight **4 N** is suspended from the rod **at <latex>\tfrac{1}{8}L</latex> from the right end**.

      An external force **F** is applied on the rod **at <latex>\tfrac{3}{4}L</latex> from the right end**. The force points **upward at an angle of <latex>60^\circ</latex>** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

      Determine the **magnitude of the force <latex>F</latex>** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

          About the pivot (right end), CCW positive:
          <latex>
          \tau_b = 4\left(\tfrac{1}{8}-0\right)=\tfrac{1}{2}, \quad
          \tau_r = 8\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right)=4, \quad
          \tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}F\big)\left(\tfrac{3}{4}-0\right) = -\tfrac{3}{8}F.
          </latex>
          Equilibrium: <latex>\tfrac{1}{2}+4-\tfrac{3}{8}F=0 \Rightarrow F=12~\text{N}</latex>.

The rod is in **static equilibrium**. A block of weight **8 N** is suspended from the rod **at <latex>\tfrac{1}{8}L</latex> from the right end**.

      An external force of magnitude **18 N** is applied on the rod **at the left end** (i.e., **at <latex>1\cdot L</latex> from the right end**). The force points **upward at an angle of <latex>60^\circ</latex>** with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured from the **right end** of the rod.

      Determine the **weight of the rod** (in newtons) required to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**
