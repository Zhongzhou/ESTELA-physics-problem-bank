    title: Static Equilibrium of a Horizontal Rod – Force Determination
    points: 1
    text: |
      A uniform thin rod of length **L = 1.0 m** is held in a **horizontal**
      position and can rotate freely about a **pivot located at the right end** of
      the rod. The system is in **static equilibrium**.

      The rod’s weight is **16 N**. A block of weight **8 N** is attached to the rod
      **at the left end**.


      An external force **F** is applied on the rod **at <latex>\tfrac{3}{4}L</latex>
      from the right end**. The force points **upward at an angle of <latex>60^\circ</latex>**
      with respect to the vertical, as shown in the image. All distances are measured
      from the **right end** of the rod.


      Determine the **magnitude of the force <latex>F</latex>** (in newtons) required
      to maintain equilibrium. **Round your answer to the nearest integer.**

        \tau_b = 8\left(1-0\right) = 8\cdot L, \quad

        \tau_r = 16\left(\tfrac{1}{2}-0\right) = 8\cdot L, \quad

        \tau_F = -\big(\tfrac{1}{2}F\big)\left(\tfrac{3}{4}-0\right) = -16\cdot L.

        </latex>

        Equilibrium: <latex>8\cdot L+8\cdot L+-16\cdot L=0</latex>, which yields the
        required value of **F**. Rounding to the nearest integer gives **43 N**.
