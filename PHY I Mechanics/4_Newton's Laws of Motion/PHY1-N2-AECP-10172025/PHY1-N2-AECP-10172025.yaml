    title: Accelerating elevator categorization problem
    bank_id: PHY1-N2-AECP-10172025 #Subject-Unit-Abbreviation_of_title_or_any_string-date
    description: |-
      This is a bank of conceptual physics problems designed for a university-level course to test students' understanding of **Newton's Second Law** in one-dimensional vertical motion.
        The problems are presented in a **categorization format**, where students must match a specific description of an object's motion to the correct physical relationship between the external applied force (like tension or normal force) and the object's weight.

        Each question is grounded in a relatable, real-world scenario (e.g., an elevator, a crate on a forklift, a bucket on a crane) and covers all six fundamental states of vertical motion:
        * Speeding up while moving upward or downward
        * Slowing down while moving upward or downward
        * Moving at a constant velocity upward or downward

        - prompt 1: |
            I'm writing multiple-choice concept questions for a university physics course testing Newton's second law of motion, involving the one-dimensional motion of an object. The problem will ask students to compare gravity and the external force during acceleration. As a first step, please help me by generating fifteen different scenarios of an object moving up or down under either a pulling or a pushing force.  
            Some examples might be:
                          An elevator is being pulled by a cable
                          A cat is in a basket being lowered from a window
                        A cargo box is being lowered or lifted by a fork lift.
            Avoid objects that are subjected to significant air resistance such as feather, avoid objects moving in outer space such as satellite or moons, avoid objects that could propel themselves such as rockets or birds, and avoid objects that is submerged in water.
            The scenario should not contain indication of velocity such as up or down, or indication of acceleration such as "speed up" or "slow down".
            Place all the scenarios in a table column named "scenario". 
        - prompt 2: |
            Examine the above scenarios, and exclude scenes in which the object is under water. Then add two columns: Direction of motion, Direction of acceleration. Each column can take three values: up, down or none, but the two columns cannot be both "none" on the same row.
        - prompt 3: |
            Actually, remove the rows in which the direction of motion is none.
        - prompt 4: |
            Add a new column to this table named "motion description" to the table, describing the motion of the object without explicitly mentioning velocity or acceleration. For example, it can say "the elevator is moving upward while speeding up" or "moving downward while slowing down", or "moving up at constant velocity". 
        - prompt 5: |
            Add a new column named "context rich description", which contain a complete sentence, such as "the elevator is moving upward while speeding up". Also, use several different expressions for different contexts, such as "moving up at an increasing rate" or "moving towards a lower floor while slowing down", or "being lifted upwards with an increasing speed".
        - prompt 6: |
            Add a new column named "External Force", that contains a description and a symbol of the external force, such as "tension (T) in the cable" or "normal force (N) by the hand"
        - prompt 7: |
            Add a new column named "Weight comparison", comparing the external force with the weight of the object (W), for each situation. It should contain expression such as "T > W" or "N = W", according to the direction of the acceleration.
        - prompt 8: |
            Add a new column to the table named "Problem body", which follow this template:
            [Scenario] Compare the [External Force] with the weight W of the [object] in each of the following three situations, and drag the correct relation to the corresponding situations.
        - prompt 9: |
                        Now write two categorization problems for each scenario. The categorization problem follows the following yaml template format:
                        ```yaml
                        - categorization:
                            id: question_categorization_1

                                - Category 1 Item 1
                                - Category 1 Item 2
                                - Category 1 Item 3
                            - category:
                                description: Category 2

                                - Category 3 Item 2
                        ```
                        The text field of both problems comes from the problem body column. Each category should correspond to one of the six rows for each scenario. The category descriptions should come from the context rich description, and each category should only have one item, coming from the Weight Comparison column, but use plain text instead of latex. 
                        For problem one, Category 1: row 1, category 2: row 3; category 3: row 5 (odd rows)
                        For problem two, Category 1: row 2, category 2: row 4; category 3: row 6 (even rows)
                        Try writing the problem yaml for the first scenario.

        The relationship between tension (<latex>T</latex>) and weight (<latex>W</latex>) is determined by the elevator's acceleration (<latex>a</latex>) according to Newton's Second Law. If we define the upward direction as positive, the net force on the elevator is given by <latex>\sum F = T - W = ma</latex>. This equation can be rearranged to solve for tension: <latex>T = W + ma</latex>.

        This core relationship allows us to analyze each situation:

        ***

        * **Situation 1: Ascending while speeding up.** The elevator has an **upward (positive) acceleration**. Since <latex>a > 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is a positive value.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + (\text{positive value})</latex>, which means **<latex>T > W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 2: Ascending at a constant speed.** The elevator has **zero acceleration**. Since <latex>a = 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is zero.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + 0</latex>, which means **<latex>T = W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 3: Descending at an increasing rate.** The elevator is speeding up in the downward direction, which means it has a **downward (negative) acceleration**. Since <latex>a < 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is a negative value.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + (\text{negative value})</latex>, which means **<latex>T < W</latex>**.
      on_correct: Correct!
      on_incorrect: Not quite, check the direction of the acceleration in each case.

        The relationship between the normal force (<latex>N</latex>) and the crate's weight (<latex>W</latex>) is determined by its acceleration (<latex>a</latex>) based on Newton's Second Law. Defining the upward direction as positive, the net force on the crate is <latex>\sum F = N - W = ma</latex>. This can be rewritten as <latex>N = W + ma</latex>.

        This core relationship allows us to analyze each situation:

        ***

        * **Situation 1: Being raised and speeding up.** The crate has an **upward (positive) acceleration**. Since <latex>a > 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is positive.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + (\text{positive value})</latex>, which means **<latex>N > W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 2: Being lifted at a constant speed.** The crate has **zero acceleration**. Since <latex>a = 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is zero.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + 0</latex>, which means **<latex>N = W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 3: Moving downward at an increasing rate.** The crate is speeding up downwards, so it has a **downward (negative) acceleration**. Since <latex>a < 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is negative.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + (\text{negative value})</latex>, which means **<latex>N < W</latex>**.
      on_correct: Correct!
      on_incorrect: Not quite, check the direction of the acceleration in each case.

        The relationship between the cable tension (<latex>T</latex>) and the cart's weight (<latex>W</latex>) depends on the cart's acceleration (<latex>a</latex>). According to Newton's Second Law, if 'up' is the positive direction, the net force is <latex>\sum F = T - W = ma</latex>. This gives us the equation <latex>T = W + ma</latex>.

        Let's analyze the three motions:

        ***

        * **Situation 1: Moving upward but its speed is decreasing.** The cart is moving up while slowing, so it has a **downward (negative) acceleration**. Because <latex>a < 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is negative.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + (\text{negative value})</latex>, and so **<latex>T < W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 2: Descending while slowing down.** The cart is moving down while slowing, so its acceleration is in the opposite (upward) direction. It has an **upward (positive) acceleration**. Because <latex>a > 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is positive.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + (\text{positive value})</latex>, and so **<latex>T > W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 3: Lowered at a steady rate.** Moving at a steady rate means there is **zero acceleration**. Because <latex>a = 0</latex>, the term <latex>ma</latex> is zero.
            Therefore, <latex>T = W + 0</latex>, and so **<latex>T = W</latex>**.

        The relationship between the normal force (<latex>N</latex>) from the hand and the books' weight (<latex>W</latex>) depends on their acceleration (<latex>a</latex>). Using Newton's Second Law with 'up' as the positive direction, the net force is <latex>\sum F = N - W = ma</latex>. This gives us the equation <latex>N = W + ma</latex>.

        We can analyze the three situations with this formula:

        ***

        * **Situation 1: Raising the stack, but the motion is slowing.** The books are moving up but slowing, which implies a **downward (negative) acceleration**. Since <latex>a < 0</latex>, <latex>ma</latex> is a negative value.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + (\text{negative value})</latex>, which means **<latex>N < W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 2: Lowering the stack while slowing its descent.** The books are moving down but slowing, so the acceleration is upward. They have an **upward (positive) acceleration**. Since <latex>a > 0</latex>, <latex>ma</latex> is a positive value.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + (\text{positive value})</latex>, which means **<latex>N > W</latex>**.

        * **Situation 3: Lowering the stack at a steady pace.** Moving at a steady pace means there is **zero acceleration**. Since <latex>a = 0</latex>, <latex>ma</latex> is zero.
            Therefore, <latex>N = W + 0</latex>, which means **<latex>N = W</latex>**.
      on_correct: Good job!
      on_incorrect: Not quite. Remember that an object slowing down has an acceleration in the opposite direction of its motion.
