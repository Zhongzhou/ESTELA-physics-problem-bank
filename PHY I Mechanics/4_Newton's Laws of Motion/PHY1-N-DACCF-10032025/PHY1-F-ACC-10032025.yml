    bank_id: PHY1-N-DACCF-10032025 #Subject-Unit-Abbreviation_of_title_or_any_string-date
    description: |-
      An applied force at an angle is acting on an object on a rough surface. Calculate the acceleration.
    date created: 10-03-2025 # Today's date
    learning objectives:
        - to be able to break down forces into components
        - to be able to apply Newton's 2nd law to find acceleration
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1.1: |
            I am writing a problem about calculating the acceleration given forces. I would like you to help me with it. Previously I had genAI help me generate problems with all the forces balanced. Now I need unbalanced situations. Attached is a yaml file with detailed documentation of the prompts I used previously to generate the balanced forces problems. The file also has the problems generated, and answer, and feedback. I would like you to modify the variables in the problems such that the forces are no longer balanced. For each problem, the question would be determining the acceleration. Please first modify the first 5 problems.
        - prompt 1.2: | #I had trouble uploading the yaml file we used for a static equilibrium problem. I tried a few times before it worked.
            Sorry for some reason it didn't get attached. Here it is.
        - prompt 1.3: # I had trouble uploading the file. ChatGPT prompted me to paste the 5 problems from yaml, and I did. I have not included the pasted syntax here because it's too long.
        - prompt 2.1: |
            please generate a yaml file for the first 5 problems
        - prompt 2.2: |
            download please
        - prompt 2.3: | #I successfully uploaded the yaml file.
            sorry I got the wrong version of yaml. Here's an updated version. Please modify the first 5 problems.
        - prompt 2.4: |
            output first please
        - prompt 2.5: |
            yes please
        - prompt 3.1: |
            oh please change the tolerance to 0.05 in each of the problems in the yaml file
        - prompt 3.2: |
            I misread. I now realized it the tolerance is in percentage. I'd like to change the tolerance to 5, please.
        - prompt 4.1: |
            please modify q6-q10

    text: |
      A worker pushes a wooden crate across a concrete floor.
      The coefficient of kinetic friction between the crate and the floor is <latex>0.36</latex>.
      The worker applies a force of <latex>465.64</latex> N at an angle of <latex>12.74^\circ</latex> downward with respect to the horizontal.
      The crate has a mass of <latex>100.00</latex> kg.
      The acceleration due to gravity is <latex>9.81</latex> m/s².

      Calculate the crate’s acceleration in units of m/s^2. Round your answers to two decimal places.

        general: |
          Take +x along the motion and +y upward. Resolve the push:
          <latex>F_x = F\cos\theta</latex>, <latex>F_y = -F\sin\theta</latex>.
          Downward push increases the normal force: <latex>N = mg + F\sin\theta</latex>.
          Kinetic friction: <latex>f_k = \mu_k N</latex>.

          Net horizontal force gives acceleration:

          a = \frac{F\cos\theta - \mu_k\,(mg + F\sin\theta)}{m}.
