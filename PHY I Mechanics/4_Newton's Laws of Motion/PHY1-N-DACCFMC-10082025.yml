    description: |-
      An applied force at an angle is acting on an object on a rough surface. Calculate the acceleration.
    date created: 10-08-2025 # Today's date 
    learning objectives:
        - to be able to break down forces into components
        - to be able to apply Newton's 2nd law to find acceleration
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1.1: |
            I am creating a problem bank about calculating the acceleration given forces. I would like you to help me with it. Previously I had genAI help me generate the problems with numerical answers. Now I want a multiple choice version. Attached is a yaml file with detailed documentation of the prompts I used previously to generate the problems. The file also has the problems generated, and answers, and feedback. For each question, I would like you to give five answer choices. The correct answer should be calculated using (F*cos_theta-mu*(mg-F*sin_theta))/m. For distractors, please use equations (1) (F*cos_theta-mu*(mg+F*sin_theta))/m, (2) (F*cos_theta-mu*mg)/m, (3) (F-mu*mg)/m, and (4) (F*sin_theta-mu*mg)/m. First, please modify q1-q5.
            # file PHY1-F-ACC-10032025.yml attached
        - prompt 1.2: |
            keep the original yaml structure please
        - prompt 1.3: |
            numeric values
        - prompt 2.1: |
            The answer choices should follow this structure: # I pasted the correct formatting for MC
        - prompt 2.2: |
            For q1, please get rid of the following: Then do the same for all five questions. # still working on formatting
        - prompt 3.1: |
            yes please
        - prompt 3.2: |
            it's the same file
        - prompt 3.3: |
            two decimal places
        - prompt 3.4: |
            yes
        - prompt 4: |
            remember when using the formulas I gave you to calculate the answer choices, you should use a positive angle if the angle is upward, a negative angle if it is downward. Please check q1-10 and update the values if they were not calculated like that.
        - prompt 5.1: |
            Good. Now for the answer choices are negative, use the absolute values.
        - prompt 5.2: |
            yes please
        - prompt 6.1: |
            Before you do that, I would like you to make two changes. For each question, (1) change "numerical" to "multiple_choice", (2) change the last line of the question statement, "Determine the [x's] acceleration. Round your answers to two decimal places" to "What is the magnitude of the [x's] acceleration?"
        - prompt 6.2: |
            yes please
        - prompt 6.3: |
            PHY1-F-ACCMC-10082025.yml
        - prompt 6.4: |
            no header lines
        - formatting prompt: "./YAML_formatting_prompt.md" #modify as needed.
    updates: 
        - update 1: (10/10/2025) Leo Murch fixed q10, distractor 4. All the answer choices were double checked using Excel.
