        - prompt 1: |-
            I'm writing multiple-chocie concept questions for a university physics course testing Newton's second law of motion, involving the one-dimensional motion of an object. As a first step, please help me by generating
            five different scenarios of an object moving in a straight line with two oposing forces acting on it. These forces could be the tension in a rope and the objects weight, the tension in a rope and the force of friction, 
            a pushing force and friction, but both should be along the direction of the objects motion or have a component in this direction. The object may be moving horizontally, vertically, or along a ramp
            a constant slope, as long as it is moving in a straight line and its path does not curve. The problem statement should be creative and in a narrative form, and give the object that is moving, the direction of
            the object's motion, and wheter the object is speeding up, slowing down or moving with a constant speed. If there is a rope involved this should also be stated implicitly. The problem should then ask for which of the two opposing 
            forces is greater. Some examples might be:
            An elevator is held by a rope and is moving up and slowing down. 
            A cart is moving to the east and speeding up.
            A sled is moving to the west on a rough surface with friction and is slowing down.
            A  box is being pulled by a rope up and moving along a smooth frictionless inclined plane but is slowing down.
            A  box is being pulled by a rope up and moving along a smooth frictionless inclined plane and moving with a constant speed.
        - prompt 2: |
            The answers to the question should be some combination of:
            Force A is greater than Force B.
            Force B is greater than Force A.
            Force A is equal to Force B.
            There's not enough information to tell.
            or similar.
        - prompt 3: |
            Please make sure that in writing the multiple-choice answers, you compare only the forces along the direction of motion. If a force is not directed along the
            direction of motion, for example the weight of an object on a ramp, then the student should be prompted to compare only the component of the forces along the 
            direction of motion. Avoid unphysical situations such as an elevator in space, a cart moving up a vertical wall etc. 
            Make sure to vary the way in which the directions are stated, for example using up and down, east and west, north and south, forward and backward, etc.
        - prompt 4: |
            Write short student facing solutions for each problem. These should briefly explain why the correct answer choice is correct, and why some of the other choices would be 
            incorrect. The explanations should rely on sound physical principles of Newton's laws of motion.

    title: Steady Upward Speed in an Elevator
    points: 1
    text: A passenger stands on a bathroom scale in an elevator that moves upward
      at a **constant speed**. Compare the normal force <latex>N</latex> from the
      scale with the passenger's weight <latex>W</latex>. Which is greater?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Use Newton's 2nd Law vertically, <latex>\sum F_y = N - W = m a_y</latex>.
        With **constant speed**, <latex>a_y = 0</latex>, so <latex>N = W</latex>.
      on_correct: Great - constant speed means zero acceleration, so the scale reads
        the true weight.
      on_incorrect: Recall that constant speed implies zero acceleration, so <latex>N
        = W</latex>.

    points: 1
    text: A delivery crate rests on the floor of an elevator. The elevator is moving
      **upward and speeding up**. Compare the normal force <latex>N</latex> exerted
      by the floor with the crate's weight <latex>W</latex>. Which is greater?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Apply Newton's 2nd Law, <latex> \sum F_y = N - W = m a_y </latex>. "Upward
        and speeding up" means <latex> a_y > 0 </latex>, hence <latex>N > W</latex>.
      on_correct: Yes - upward acceleration requires an upward-net force, so <latex>N
        > W</latex>.
      on_incorrect: 'Remember: speeding up in the direction of motion (up) means <latex>a_y</latex>
        is up, so <latex>N > W</latex>.'

    title: Slowing Down While Moving Up
    points: 1
    text: A person rides an elevator that is moving **upward but slowing down**. Compare
      the scale's normal force <latex>N</latex> with the person's weight <latex>W</latex>.
      Which is greater?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: With upward motion but slowing down, the acceleration is **downward**.
        From <latex>\sum F_y = N - W = m a_y</latex> with <latex>a_y < 0</latex>,
        we get <latex>N < W</latex>.
      on_correct: Exactly - downward acceleration means the weight exceeds the normal
        force.
      on_incorrect: Since it's slowing while moving up, acceleration is down; that
        requires <latex>N < W</latex>.

    title: Speeding Up While Moving Down
    points: 1
    text: A tool cart rests on an elevator floor. The elevator is moving **downward
      and speeding up**. Compare the normal force <latex>N</latex> from the floor
      with the cart's weight <latex>W</latex>. Which is greater?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: '"Downward and speeding up" means the acceleration is **down**: <latex>a_y
        < 0</latex>. With <latex>\sum F_y = N - W = m a_y</latex>, we have <latex>N
        < W</latex>.'
      on_correct: Correct - downward acceleration implies <latex>N < W</latex>.
      on_incorrect: Think "net force follows acceleration." If <latex>a</latex> is
        down, the larger force must be down (weight).

    title: Slowing Down While Moving Down
    points: 1
    text: A sealed box hangs from the elevator ceiling by a vertical rope. The elevator
      is moving **downward but slowing down**. Compare the rope tension <latex>T</latex>
      with the box's weight <latex>W</latex>. Which is greater?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: T > W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: T = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: T < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Take up as positive. Moving down but **slowing** means <latex>a_y >
        0</latex>. From <latex>\sum F_y = T - W = m a_y</latex>, we have <latex>T
        > W</latex>.
      on_correct: Nice - slowing while moving down means acceleration up, so <latex>T
        > W</latex>.
      on_incorrect: Since the box is slowing on the way down, its acceleration is
        up; that requires <latex>T > W</latex>.

    title: Rocket Launch from Rest
    points: 1
    text: A small rocket launches vertically upward from rest. The engines produce
      a constant upward thrust <latex>T</latex>. While the rocket is accelerating
      upward, how does the thrust compare with its weight <latex>W</latex>?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: T > W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: T = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: T < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Using Newton's 2nd Law, <latex>\sum F_y = T - W = m a_y</latex>. Since
        <latex>a_y > 0</latex>, we have <latex>T > W</latex>.
      on_correct: Yes - upward acceleration requires thrust greater than weight.
      on_incorrect: To lift off and accelerate upward, the upward thrust must exceed
        the weight.

    title: Parachutist Falling at Constant Speed
    points: 1
    text: A skydiver falls vertically at **constant speed** with the parachute open.
      Compare the upward air resistance force <latex>F_{\text{air}}</latex> with the
      skydiver's weight <latex>W</latex>.
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: F_air > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: F_air = W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: F_air < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Constant speed implies <latex>a_y = 0</latex>. From <latex>\sum F_y
        = F_{\text{air}} - W = 0</latex>, it follows that <latex>F_{\text{air}} =
        W</latex>.
      on_correct: Good - terminal velocity means the upward and downward forces balance.
      on_incorrect: Constant speed implies no acceleration, so the two forces must
        be equal.

    title: Bungee Jumper Rebounding Upward
    points: 1
    text: A bungee jumper has just reached the lowest point and is pulled **upward**
      by the stretched cord. At an instant when she is moving upward and **slowing
      down**, compare the tension <latex>T</latex> in the cord with her weight <latex>W</latex>.
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: T > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: T = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: T < W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Define upward as positive. Moving up while slowing means <latex>a_y
        < 0</latex> (down). With <latex>\sum F_y = T - W = m a_y</latex>, we get <latex>T
        < W</latex>.
      on_correct: Yes - moving up but slowing means acceleration down, so <latex>T
        < W</latex>.
      on_incorrect: Decelerating upward implies a downward net force; thus <latex>W
        > T</latex>.

    title: Car Cresting a Hill
    points: 1
    text: A car travels over the top of a rounded hill at **constant speed**. Compare
      the normal force <latex>N</latex> from the road with the car's weight <latex>W</latex>
      at the very top.
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: 'At the crest, centripetal acceleration is downward: <latex>a_c = v^2/r</latex>.
        Using <latex>W - N = m a_c</latex> gives <latex>N = W - m a_c</latex>, so
        <latex>N < W</latex>.'
      on_correct: Great - the road pushes less than your weight at the top of the
        hill.
      on_incorrect: The car accelerates downward at the crest, so the normal force
        must be smaller than the weight.

    title: Airplane in Turbulence
    points: 1
    text: A coffee cup sits on a tray table in an airplane. The plane suddenly accelerates
      **upward** for a brief moment. How does the normal force <latex>N</latex> on
      the cup compare with its weight <latex>W</latex> during that instant?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: N > W
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: N = W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: N < W
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: There isn't enough information to decide
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: Take upward as positive. With <latex>a_y > 0</latex>, <latex>\sum F_y
        = N - W = m a_y</latex> implies <latex>N = W + m a_y</latex>, so <latex>N
        > W</latex>.
      on_correct: Right - upward acceleration increases the apparent weight.
      on_incorrect: Since the plane accelerates upward, the tray must push harder,
        so <latex>N > W</latex>.

    title: Subway Train Braking to a Stop
    points: 1
    text: A commuter stands on a subway train that is moving forward but **slowing
      down** as it approaches a station. The horizontal force of the floor on the
      commuter's shoes is <latex>F_{\text{floor}}</latex>. What is the direction of
      this force on the commuter?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: Forward (same direction as motion)
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: Backward (opposite the direction of motion)
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: Upward
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: Downward
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: The train's acceleration is backward. The frictional force from the
        floor on the commuter points backward to provide that deceleration.
      on_correct: Yes - the backward frictional force provides the deceleration.
      on_incorrect: The floor must push backward to slow the commuter's forward motion.

    title: Ice Skater Pushed Horizontally
    points: 1
    text: A skater on frictionless ice is pushed horizontally by a constant force
      <latex>F_{\text{push}}</latex>. Air resistance is negligible. After the push
      **ends**, what is her acceleration?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: Acceleration continues at the same rate
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: Acceleration becomes zero
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: Acceleration reverses direction
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: Acceleration increases
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: When the push ends, <latex>F_{\text{net}} = 0</latex> (no friction,
        negligible drag), so <latex>a = 0</latex>. She continues at constant velocity.
      on_correct: Correct - with no net force, the acceleration drops to zero.
      on_incorrect: When the push stops, the force vanishes, so no acceleration remains.

    title: Tug-of-War at Steady Pull
    points: 1
    text: Two teams in a tug-of-war pull so the rope's center **does not accelerate**.
      If the rope's tension is <latex>T</latex>, what can you say about the forces
      each team exerts?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: Each team exerts an equal and opposite force of magnitude T
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: The team that wins exerts a greater force
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: The rope's tension must be zero
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: Only the heavier team feels a force
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: No acceleration implies zero net force. By Newton's 3rd Law, each
        side pulls with equal magnitude and opposite direction, <latex>F_1 = F_2 =
        T</latex>.
      on_correct: Excellent - the balanced pulls produce no acceleration.
      on_incorrect: Equal and opposite pulls keep the rope in equilibrium.

    title: Satellite Orbiting Earth
    points: 1
    text: A satellite moves in a circular orbit around Earth at constant speed. Which
      statement about the forces is correct?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: The gravitational force equals the centripetal force in magnitude
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: There is no net force because the speed is constant
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: A forward thrust keeps the satellite moving
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: The gravitational force acts outward
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: 'The velocity continually changes direction, so there is inward (centripetal)
        acceleration. Gravity provides exactly this: <latex>F_g = m v^2 / r</latex>.'
      on_correct: Yes - gravity is the centripetal force that keeps it in orbit.
      on_incorrect: The satellite is constantly accelerating inward, so a net inward
        force must exist.

    title: Elevator Cable Failure (Free Fall)
    points: 1
    text: An elevator-s cable snaps and the elevator falls freely. What does a scale
      on the floor read during the free fall?
    answers:
    - answer:
        text: It reads the person's true weight
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: It reads zero
        correct: true
    - answer:
        text: It reads more than the true weight
        correct: false
    - answer:
        text: It fluctuates unpredictably
        correct: false
    feedback:
      general: In free fall, elevator and person both accelerate downward at <latex>g</latex>,
        so the normal force is <latex>N = 0</latex>. Scales read <latex>N</latex>,
        hence zero.
      on_correct: Correct - free fall means no normal force, so the scale reads zero.
      on_incorrect: In free fall, you and the elevator fall together, removing the
        contact force.
