        - prompt 1: |
            I wanted to create a family of physics problems regarding simple harmonic motion. First, let's create a table for planning. I want the problems to involve two systems, a box attached to a spring on frictionless horizontal surface, and a pendulum swinging at small angle. Each system have two starting conditions at t = 0. First condition is that the system is at equilibrium position with a starting velocity v. The second condition is that the system is at maximum displacement from equilibrium, A, with 0 velocity. For each case, I would like you to write down the time dependent expression of the position, velocity, acceleration, kinetic energy and potential energy of the system. Please first create a table that contains all the above information.
        - prompt 2: |
             Great, just one update request: in the table, for each expression replace \omega with the actual expression involving either k, m or l, g.
        - prompt 3: |
             Now try to write the first problem for the first case of the Spring-mass system, starting from maximum velocity at equilibrium. The problem is multiple choice, and asks students to choose the correct expression for the position of the pendulum. Do not write the choice items for now, just write the problem body.
        - prompt 4: | #yaml example omitted.
             This looks good, now write the MC problem following the Example below
        - prompt 5: |
            The distractors should be all the other expressions under the current situation (velocity, acceleration, kinetic energy, potential energy), plus all the expressions from the block starting at maximum displacement situation.
        - prompt 6: |
            Now create 4 more problems using the same problem setup, but ask for a different expression (velocity, acceleration, kinetic energy, and potential energy) each time. Still using the same yaml format. 
        - prompt 7: |
            Now write the same set of 5 problems for the situation where the block is released from a distance A away from the center with zero initial velocity.
        - prompt 8: |
            One small change, in the last 5 questions, add " assuming that the block is at x = 0 when the spring is at equilibrium length" after the second sentence in the problem body.
        - prompt 9: |
            Check all the choice items, and remove variable labels such as x(t) =, v(t) =, a(t) = ..... from the expression. Those are a give-away for students to guess the correct answers because the distractors don't have them.
        - prompt 10: |
            Now, in a new document, please write the problem body for the first case in the pendulum setup, for the situation that the pendulum starts at its lowest points with initial velocity v.
        - prompt 11: |
            This looks good, now write the first set of 5 problems, following the same setup as the block and spring problems, asking for a different expression in each situation, and using the expression for the other situation as distractors.
        - prompt 12: |
            Great, now create the next 5 problems, for the case where the blob is being pulled to an angle \Theta, and released with zero initial angular velocity.

        general: |
            The general solution for simple harmonic motion is <latex>x(t) = A \sin(\omega t + \phi)</latex> or <latex>x(t) = A \cos(\omega t + \phi')</latex>.
            
            1. **Determine the trigonometric function:** Since the block starts at the equilibrium position (<latex>x=0</latex>) at <latex>t=0</latex>, a sine function is most appropriate because <latex>\sin(0) = 0</latex>.
            2. **Determine the sign:** The velocity is positive at <latex>t=0</latex>. The derivative of sine is cosine, and <latex>\cos(0) = 1</latex> (positive), so we use positive sine.
            3. **Determine angular frequency:** For a spring-mass system, the angular frequency is <latex>\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</latex>.
            
            Putting this together, the position function is:
            <latex>
            x(t) = A \sin\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t\right)
            </latex>
        on_correct: Correct! Since the block starts at equilibrium, we use the sine function, and the angular frequency for a spring is determined by k and m.
        on_incorrect: Remember to check the initial conditions (t=0, x=0) and ensure the units match a position function (meters), not velocity (m/s) or energy (Joules).

            Velocity is the derivative of position. 
            
            1. **Start with Position:** We know <latex>x(t) = A \sin(\omega t)</latex>.
            2. **Differentiate:** <latex>v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}[A \sin(\omega t)] = A\omega \cos(\omega t)</latex>.
            3. **Substitute Omega:** With <latex>\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}</latex>, the expression becomes <latex>v(t) = A\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cos\left(\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} t\right)</latex>.
        on_correct: Correct! Velocity is the time derivative of position.
        on_incorrect: Check your derivative rules. The derivative of sine is cosine. Also, don't forget the chain rule which brings out a factor of omega.
