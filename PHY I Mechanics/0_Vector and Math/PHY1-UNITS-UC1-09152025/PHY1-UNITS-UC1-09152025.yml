        - prompt 1: |-
            I want to write a problem set about unit conversion. There is an example problem that I would like to create a set of similar problems 
            in the sense of keeping the important features of the problem while varying the rest of the context. 
            The main feature is that the conversion is from or to a fictional unit. The fictional unit can be related to any physical quantity, not just length or area. 
            The problem involves a chain of unit conversion steps (not just one.) Here's the example I like: 
            "Robert made up his own unit of measuring distances, which he calls the Bob (B). 
            Each Bob is 42 meters. If 1 acre = 43,560 ft2, and 1 m = 3.281 ft, what is 2.4 Acres in B2 (squared Bobs)?" First, come up with 5 ideas.
            
        - prompt 2: | 
            For each of the fictious units, come up with a plausible realistic scenario in which a person would define such unit for everyday use or a project. 
            List the units, the corresponding scenarios, and how the units are defined. 
            Double check that the values chosen for the defintion of each units makes sense in the given context. 
        - prompt 3: |
            Turn each scenario into a word problem and include the context in the problem statement. 
            Make sure that the physical quantity being converted to the given unit is reasonable in the given context.            
        - prompt 4: |
            Next, generate a solution in latex for the first problem on one line: 
            start with the physical quantity to be calculated in its given unit (e.g. "Volume = "), 
            then multiply by conversion factors that are equal to one, and find the answer in the required units. 
            color code the conversion factors such that terms with the same unit have the same color.
