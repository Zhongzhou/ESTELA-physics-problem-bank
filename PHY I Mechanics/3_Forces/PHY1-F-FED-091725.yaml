        TASK Generate a Canvas-compatible YAML problem bank of 25 multiple-choice questions about objects subject to THREE OR MORE forces (e.g., weight, normal(s), tension(s), friction, drag, applied push/pull). The objects must be inanimate (blocks, crates, beams, signs, doors, sleds, carts, ladders, traffic lights, plates, platforms, toolboxes, elevators, etc.).
        EXCLUDE ANY SPRINGS (no spring forces or k, no Hooke’s law).

        ALLOWED PHYSICS SITUATIONS (mix across items)
        • Static equilibrium in 2D (∑Fx=0, ∑Fy=0), including multi-support signs/lights, plates on two cables, ladders against walls (with/without friction at wall), beams with a load and two supports.
        • Dynamic but straight-line motion with known acceleration (elevators, crates on inclines pulled by ropes, blocks with multiple pulls + friction, sled with wind drag + pull).
        • Junctions with multiple tensions (two-rope/three-rope nodes at angles).
        • Inclines with friction + push/pull + weight + normal (≥3 forces).
        • Pulleys allowed only if the analyzed body itself has ≥3 forces (e.g., a block on an incline pulled by a rope over a pulley with friction on the block).

        HARD CONSTRAINTS (must follow)
        • Output ONE valid YAML document with a single top-level key: questions:
        • Create exactly 25 items, ids q-1 … q-25 (no gaps).
        • Each item must be a multiple choice with EXACTLY 4 options and exactly ONE correct option.
        • SI units only; use g = 9.81 m/s^2.
        • Every item’s stem must include concrete numbers (masses, angles, coefficients, forces, accelerations as relevant) and define any symbols you use.
        • Every correct option is a single numeric value with unit (e.g., “3.2 N”, “1.8 m/s²”, “540 N”, “28°”).
        • Round the correct option to 2–3 significant figures; end every stem with: “Select the best answer.”
        • Include feedback with:
          general: short method outline (concept → equations → substitution path),
          on_correct: "Correct!",
          on_incorrect: short nudge about the most likely misconception.

              on_correct: "Correct!"
              on_incorrect: "Check the free-body diagram and component balances."

        CONTENT MIX & ASK TYPES (distribute across the 25)
        • 8–10 items: find a single TENSION in one cable/rope.
        • 6–8 items: find NORMAL force on a surface (may be ≠ mg).
        • 4–5 items: find required FRICTION magnitude (static or kinetic; specify μs or μk).
        • 3–4 items: find NET ACCELERATION magnitude or direction.
        • 3–4 items: find an APPLIED FORCE needed to maintain rest or a stated acceleration.
        (Items can satisfy multiple categories; ensure overall coverage. Absolutely NO springs.)

        NUMERIC RANGES (realistic values; randomize)
        • Masses: 1–80 kg (small objects), up to 150 kg for beams/signs.
        • Angles: 10°–75° (state reference: from horizontal or from ceiling/wall).
        • μs, μk: 0.10–0.60 (specify which).
        • Tensions & normals: typically 10–2,000 N.
        • Accelerations (if nonzero): 0.2–4.0 m/s².

        PHYSICS RULES & MODELING GUIDANCE
        • Build (internally) a free-body diagram for the target object only. Include ALL forces that act on that object. Each support/contact contributes its own force (normal or tension).
        • Equilibrium: set ∑Fx=0 and ∑Fy=0. For ladders/beams you may use torques ONLY if the body is an extended rigid body; then provide a length (1.5–6.0 m) and load location. Otherwise keep to force balances (no torques).
        • Dynamics: use ∑F = m a along chosen axes; resolve components clearly.
        • Friction: state whether static (unknown magnitude ≤ μs N) or kinetic (μk N). Choose direction to oppose impending/actual motion; do NOT set f=μN in static unless you state it is at threshold.
        • Two-rope nodes: define angle references; solve via components. All angles must be clearly stated.

        DISTRACTOR ENGINE (each item must include three plausible wrong numbers)
        Create distractors by exactly one of the following per wrong option:
        1) Component-blunder: use T cos instead of T sin (or vice versa).
        2) Ignore one force: omit friction or one tension in ∑F.
        3) Wrong friction model: use μk instead of μs or set f=μN at rest incorrectly.
        4) Sign/axis error: add components that should balance (e.g., N = mg + something when it should be less).
        5) Round-off or unit trap: compute correctly but round incorrectly (or subtly change unit).
        Keep distractors within ~10–35% of the correct value (except one “far” option at ~0.5× or ~2×).

        QUALITY & CLARITY RULES
        • Title ≤ 70 chars; name the scenario (e.g., “Sign hung by two cables at unequal angles”).
        • Stem must state: masses, angles with reference, μs/μk when relevant, any given acceleration (magnitude & direction), and whether the object is at rest or moving.
        • Define symbols on first use (e.g., “θ is measured from the horizontal”).
        • Units on ALL numbers in the stem and ALL answer options.
        • No images/diagrams, no markdown headings, no emojis.

        VALIDATION (self-check before emitting YAML)
        For each item:
        1) Compute the correct numeric answer from the given data.
        2) Round to 2–3 sig figs and place as the single correct option.
        3) Generate three distinct distractors using the DISTRACTOR ENGINE; ensure all four options are unique and include units.
        4) Confirm the analyzed object has ≥3 forces. If not, fix the scenario.
        5) Ensure the question matches the schema and compiles as valid YAML.

        OUTPUT
        Return ONLY the YAML with the top-level key questions: and the 25 items beneath it. No extra commentary, no markdown.
