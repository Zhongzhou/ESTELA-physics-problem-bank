### **1. Person Pushing a Refrigerator**

First, notice that the refrigerator is not moving, which means the net force on the object is zero in both horizontal and vertical directions according to Newton’s second law.

Next, we can define the friction force $f$ as the horizontal force that prevents the object from moving. Since the applied force has both horizontal and vertical components, we focus on the horizontal part.

We can then write down the force balance in the horizontal direction:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving for static friction:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Note: The expression $f = \mu N$ gives the **maximum** possible static friction, but the actual static friction can be less than this maximum as it adjusts to match the applied force.

### **2. Tow Truck Pulling a Stalled SUV**

First, since the SUV remains stationary, Newton’s second law tells us that the net force must be zero in both directions.

We define $f$ as the static friction that counters the towing force. The rope applies force at an angle, so only its horizontal component contributes to motion.

We can then write the force equation in the x-direction:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving for friction gives:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Remember, $f = \mu N$ is the **maximum** static friction force possible. The actual friction is just enough to prevent movement.

### **3. Factory Worker Pushing a Pallet Jack**

First, observe that the object remains at rest, so Newton's second law implies that forces balance in both axes.

The worker pushes at a downward angle. To analyze horizontal motion, define $f$ as the friction resisting the push.

We write the horizontal force balance as:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving this gives:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Keep in mind, $\mu N$ gives the **maximum** possible static friction. The real value adjusts to match the applied horizontal force unless that maximum is exceeded.

### **4. Horse Pulling a Plow**

Since the plow does not move, Newton's second law ensures zero net force in all directions.

The horse pulls at an upward angle, which affects both vertical and horizontal forces. Define $f$ as the horizontal static friction.

We then express the horizontal force balance:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

This leads to:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Note that $f = \mu N$ only applies to the **maximum** static friction value; the actual friction may be lower.

### **5. Person Pulling a Suitcase**

We know the suitcase is stationary, so the total force must be zero in both directions.

Here, the pulling force is angled upward. To find the actual static friction $f$, consider only the horizontal forces.

We write:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Keep in mind that $\mu N$ is the maximum static friction; the real friction is what balances the applied horizontal force.

### **6. Forklift Dragging Container**

First, note the container doesn’t move, which means the net force on the object is zero in both the horizontal and vertical directions, according to Newton’s second law.

The forklift applies a pulling force at a downward angle. To find the static friction force, we examine forces in the horizontal direction.

We define $f$ as the static friction force. Since the pulling force has a horizontal component:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving for $f$:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Note: The expression $f = \mu N$ represents the **maximum** static friction. The actual friction force can be smaller, just enough to prevent motion.

---

### **7. Two People Pushing a Car**

Because the car remains stationary, Newton’s second law implies that all forces balance out, both horizontally and vertically.

The people are pushing at a downward angle, which affects the normal force but also contributes a horizontal force component.

We define $f$ as the static friction force opposing motion. Summing forces in the horizontal direction gives:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving for $f$:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Remember that $\mu N$ is only the **maximum possible** static friction. The actual force adjusts as needed to keep the object from moving.

### **8. Robotic Rover Pulling Toolbox**

Since the toolbox remains at rest, the total force on it is zero in both directions, per Newton’s second law.

The rover pulls the toolbox using a tether that is angled upward. This force has a horizontal component responsible for potentially moving the box.

We define $f$ as the static friction force. Summing forces along the horizontal axis gives:

$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$

Solving:

$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$

Again, while $f = \mu N$ describes the **maximum** static friction, the actual static friction force is exactly what is needed to keep the object at rest.

### **9. Worker Pushing a Cement Mixer**

First, since the cement mixer remains stationary, Newton’s second law tells us that the net force must be zero in both the horizontal and vertical directions.

The worker applies force at a downward angle, so we must consider the horizontal component of this force to find the friction. We can define $f$ as the static friction force that opposes the push.

We can write the force equation in the x-direction:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$
Solving for the static friction gives:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
It's important to remember that $f = \mu_s N$ gives the **maximum** possible static friction. The actual static friction adjusts to be equal and opposite to the applied horizontal force, as long as that force is less than the maximum.

---

### **10. Delivery Robot Pulling a Cart**

Because the cart does not move, we know from Newton's second law that the net force on it is zero.

The robot pulls the cart with a tether angled upward. To find the static friction, $f$, we only need to consider the forces acting along the horizontal axis.

The force balance equation in the horizontal direction is:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$Solving this for the friction force, we get:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
Remember, the value $\mu_s N$ represents the **maximum** static friction. The actual static friction is the force required to prevent motion, which is equal to the horizontal component of the pulling force.

### **11. Person Pushing a Bookshelf**

First, observe that the bookshelf is not moving. According to Newton's second law, this means the total force on the bookshelf is zero in all directions.

The person is pushing at a downward angle. The force that static friction must oppose is the horizontal component of this push. Let's call the static friction force $f$.

The sum of the horizontal forces is:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$Therefore, the static friction is:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
Note that the formula $f = \mu_s N$ calculates the **maximum** value of static friction. The actual static friction force is just strong enough to counteract the horizontal component of the applied force.

### **12. Worker Pulling a Hand Truck**

Since the hand truck remains at rest, we know that the net force acting on it is zero, as stated by Newton's second law.

The worker is pulling at an upward angle. The static friction, $f$, acts horizontally to oppose the horizontal component of the worker's pull.

We can write the equation for the forces in the horizontal direction:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$This gives us the magnitude of the static friction:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
Keep in mind that $\mu_s N$ is the **maximum** static friction possible. The actual static friction adjusts its magnitude to be exactly equal to the opposing horizontal force.

---

### **13. Athlete Pushing a Sled**

The problem states that the sled does not move, which means the forces are balanced, and the net force is zero according to Newton's second law.

The athlete pushes with a force directed at a downward angle. The static friction, which we'll call $f$, acts horizontally to oppose the motion. We only need to consider the horizontal component of the athlete's push.

The force balance in the horizontal direction is:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$Solving for the static friction, we find:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
It is crucial to understand that $\mu_s N$ gives the **maximum** static friction. The actual static friction force is simply the amount needed to keep the sled stationary.

### **14. Gardener Pulling a Lawn Roller**

We are told the lawn roller stays still, so we can apply Newton's second law, which tells us the net force is zero.

The gardener pulls the roller with a rope at an upward angle. The static friction force, $f$, must perfectly counteract the horizontal component of this pulling force.

The sum of forces in the horizontal direction is:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$Solving for $f$ yields:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
Remember, the expression $\mu_s N$ calculates the **maximum** possible static friction. The actual static friction here is just what is necessary to prevent movement.

### **15. Machine Pushing a Steel Drum**

Because the steel drum remains stationary, the net force on it in any direction is zero, in accordance with Newton's second law.

The machine applies a force at a downward angle. The static friction force, $f$, acts in the opposite horizontal direction to prevent the drum from sliding.

We can set up the force balance equation for the horizontal axis:
$$f - F \cos(\theta) = 0$$This allows us to solve for the static friction:$$f = F \cos(\theta)$$
Note that $\mu_s N$ represents the **maximum** available static friction. The actual static friction force will be equal in magnitude to the horizontal component of the applied force, as long as this component does not exceed the maximum.
