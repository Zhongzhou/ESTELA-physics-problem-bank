    title: Horse Pulling a Plow
    points: 1
    text: |
      A farmer is using a horse to pull a heavy plow across a flat field. The plow rests on a horizontal patch of dry dirt and remains stationary, even though the horse is actively pulling. The horse pulls with a force of 936.8 N through a rope that forms an angle of 57.5° upward with respect to the horizontal. The mass of the plow is 300 kg, and the coefficient of static friction between the plow and the ground is 0.25. Find the static friction in units of Newtons.
