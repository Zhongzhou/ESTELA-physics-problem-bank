    description: |-
      An applied force at an angle is acting on an object. The object remains at rest. The goal is to find the static friction. A common mistake is to use static friction coefficient times normal force to get static friction.
    date created: 09-16-2025 # Today's date 
    learning objectives:
        - to be able to determine static friction when it is not at maximum
        - to be able to apply Newton's 2nd law for static equilibrium problem
        - to be able to break down forces into components
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1.1: |
            I am a college professor writing physics problems about calculating static friction. I am asking you to help me write the problems. First, please generate 10 different cases of an object being pulled or pushed by either a human, an animal, or a machine/vehicle, but the object remains stationary on a surface. Indicate whether the pushing or pulling force must be angled upwards or downwards. Here are some examples: horse pulling a sledge on snow. upwards. A person pushing a couch across carpeted floor. Downwards a person dragging a heavy luggage case. Upwards. A towing truck dragging a damaged car on rough road. Upwards
        - prompt 1.2: |
            I don't want snow or ice. I need surface with some friction and the surface needs to be horizontal
        - prompt 2: |
            Now for each of those 10 cases, first generate the following set of values 1. Coefficient of static friction, \mu_k. Between 0.1 and 0.5 2. Angle of the force \theta. Positive 10 degrees to 60 degrees if the force is upwards, negative 10 degrees to 60 degrees if the force is downwards. 3. Mass of the object being pulled or pushed, M. Appropriate for the object being pushed or pulled, in units of kg. 4. Generate an estimation of the maximum force F_max that can be exerted by the human, animal or machine doing the pushing or pulling (not the object). 5. Generate the push or pulled force F in units of N. Be sure the force is a lot smaller than the maximum force. 6. Calculate the absolute value of F*cos(\theta) 7. Calculate \mu*(m*g-F*sin(\theta))
        - prompt 3.1: |
            Now check if the magnitude of F*cos(\theta) is smaller than \mu*(m*g-F*sin(\theta)). If yes, list the values. If not, re-generate the numbers.

Explain the known variables: mu, m, force applied, angle of the force applied. 3. Ask students to calculate the static friction and specify the unit. For example, find the static friction in units of Newtons.. 4. When stating the angle, explicitly state if it is upward or downward with respect to the horizontal, but not write any negative signs. 5. If the object is pulled by a rope or a chain or similar objects, state the angle as the rope/chain forms an angle of ….. with respect to the horizon

    text: |
      A farmer is using a horse to pull a heavy plow across a flat field. The plow rests on a horizontal patch of dry dirt and remains stationary, even though the horse is actively pulling. The horse pulls with a force of 936.8 N through a rope that forms an angle of 57.5° upward with respect to the horizontal. The mass of the plow is 300 kg, and the coefficient of static friction between the plow and the ground is 0.25. Find the magnitude of the static friction.

        general: |
          Since the plow does not move, Newton's second law ensures zero net force in all directions.

          The horse pulls at an upward angle, which affects both vertical and horizontal forces. Define <latex>f</latex> as the horizontal static friction.

          We then express the horizontal force balance:

          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>

          This leads to:

          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>

          Note that <latex>f = \mu N</latex> only applies to the **maximum** static friction value; the actual friction may be lower.

          First, notice that the couch is not moving, which means the net force on the object is zero in both horizontal and vertical directions according to Newton’s second law.

          Next, we can define the friction force <latex>f</latex> as the horizontal force that prevents the object from moving. Since the applied force has both horizontal and vertical components, we focus on the horizontal part.

          We can then write down the force balance in the horizontal direction:

          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>

          Solving for static friction:

          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>

          Note: The expression <latex>f = \mu N</latex> gives the **maximum** possible static friction, but the actual static friction can be less than this maximum as it adjusts to match the applied force.

          We know the suitcase is stationary, so the total force must be zero in both directions.

          Here, the pulling force is angled upward. To find the actual static friction <latex>f</latex>, consider only the horizontal forces.

          We write:

          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>

          Solving:

          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>

          Keep in mind that <latex>\mu N</latex> is the maximum static friction; the real friction is what balances the applied horizontal force.

          First, since the car remains stationary, Newton’s second law tells us that the net force must be zero in both directions.

          We define <latex>f</latex> as the static friction that counters the towing force. The rope applies force at an angle, so only its horizontal component contributes to motion.

          We can then write the force equation in the x-direction:

          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>

          Solving for friction gives:

          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>

          Remember, <latex>f = \mu N</latex> is the **maximum** static friction force possible. The actual friction is just enough to prevent movement.

          We write the horizontal force balance as:

          Since the wagon remains at rest, the total force on it is zero in both directions, per Newton’s second law.

          The child pulls the wagon using a rope that is angled upward. This force has a horizontal component responsible for potentially moving the wagon.

          We define <latex>f</latex> as the static friction force. Summing forces along the horizontal axis gives:

          Because the cart does not move, we know from Newton's second law that the net force on it is zero.

          The robot pulls the cart with a tether angled upward. To find the static friction, <latex>f</latex>, we only need to consider the forces acting along the horizontal axis.

          The force balance equation in the horizontal direction is:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          Solving this for the friction force, we get:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          Remember, the value <latex>\mu_s N</latex> represents the **maximum** static friction. The actual static friction is the force required to prevent motion, which is equal to the horizontal component of the pulling force.

          First, observe that the bookshelf is not moving. According to Newton's second law, this means the total force on the bookshelf is zero in all directions.

          The person is pushing at a downward angle. The force that static friction must oppose is the horizontal component of this push. Let's call the static friction force <latex>f</latex>.

          The sum of the horizontal forces is:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          Therefore, the static friction is:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          Note that the formula <latex>f = \mu_s N</latex> calculates the **maximum** value of static friction. The actual static friction force is just strong enough to counteract the horizontal component of the applied force.

          Since the hand truck remains at rest, we know that the net force acting on it is zero, as stated by Newton's second law.

          The worker is pulling at an upward angle. The static friction, <latex>f</latex>, acts horizontally to oppose the horizontal component of the worker's pull.

          We can write the equation for the forces in the horizontal direction:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          This gives us the magnitude of the static friction:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          Keep in mind that <latex>\mu_s N</latex> is the **maximum** static friction possible. The actual static friction adjusts its magnitude to be exactly equal to the opposing horizontal force.

          The problem states that the sled does not move, which means the forces are balanced, and the net force is zero according to Newton's second law.

          The athlete pushes with a force directed at a downward angle. The static friction, which we'll call <latex>f</latex>, acts horizontally to oppose the motion. We only need to consider the horizontal component of the athlete's push.

          The force balance in the horizontal direction is:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          Solving for the static friction, we find:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          It is crucial to understand that <latex>\mu_s N</latex> gives the **maximum** static friction. The actual static friction force is simply the amount needed to keep the sled stationary.

          We are told the lawn roller stays still, so we can apply Newton's second law, which tells us the net force is zero.

          The gardener pulls the roller with a rope at an upward angle. The static friction force, <latex>f</latex>, must perfectly counteract the horizontal component of this pulling force.

          The sum of forces in the horizontal direction is:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          Solving for <latex>f</latex> yields:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          Remember, the expression <latex>\mu_s N</latex> calculates the **maximum** possible static friction. The actual static friction here is just what is necessary to prevent movement.

          Because the steel drum remains stationary, the net force on it in any direction is zero, in accordance with Newton's second law.

          The machine applies a force at a downward angle. The static friction force, <latex>f</latex>, acts in the opposite horizontal direction to prevent the drum from sliding.

          We can set up the force balance equation for the horizontal axis:
          
          <latex>f - F \cos(\theta) = 0</latex>
          
          This allows us to solve for the static friction:
          
          <latex>f = F \cos(\theta)</latex>
          
          Note that <latex>\mu_s N</latex> represents the **maximum** available static friction. The actual static friction force will be equal in magnitude to the horizontal component of the applied force, as long as this component does not exceed the maximum.
