    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: | # I copied the output of each batch of problems into an md file.
            I would like to create physics problems about newton's 3rd law of motion for my class. The problem consists of the following parts:
                1. A situation involving three connected objects, presumably in balance, such as a person sitting on a swing connected to the swing frame, or a lamp hanging from a chain connected to the ceiling.
                2. Two correct answers:
                a. Each answer should describe a Newton's 3rd law force pair among the objects.
                3. Three distractors:
                a. Distractor 1: Weight of an object and the supporting force, such as normal force or tension.
                b. Distractor 2: Weight of two objects combined and the supporting force
                c. Distractor 3: Two opposing forces on acting on different objects in the system.
                Here is an example:

                Situation: A person is sitting on a mattress placed on a bed frame.

                Correct 1: Normal force by the person on the mattress and normal force by the mattress on the person.
                Correct 2: Normal force by the bed frame on the floor and the normal force by the floor on the bed frame
                Distractor 1: The weight of the person and the supporting force by the mattress
                Distractor 2: The weight of the person plus the mattress and the supporting force from the bedframe.
                Distractor 3: The normal force by the person on the mattress and the normal force by the bed frame on the mattress

                First, create 5 different versions according to this example format.
        - prompt 1.1: | 
                Do not include images, and don't specify whether the system is stationary or not (this doesn't affect the answer choices).
        - prompt 1.2: | 
                Do not include images, and don't specify whether the system is stationary or not (this doesn't affect the answer choices).
        - prompt 1.3: |
                Great, write another 10 different versions please.
        - prompt 1.4: |
                Great, now generate another batch of 10 such problem descriptions
        - prompt 2: | # I uploaded the md file containing 25 problem stems, and a template yaml file (this file before it was edited with a multiple answer problem example)
                I have 25 versions of the description of physics problems in this file. I would like to write them into the yaml format, as shown in the example in the N3-draft yaml file. Here are the requirements:
                1. Each problem body should explain the problem situation, then ask "which two forces are equal and opposite because they are Newton's 3rd law force pairs? Select all options that are correct".
                2. The solution to each problem should be short and mostly the same across multiple problems, stating the general principle that Newton's 3rd law force pairs must originate from the same interaction, and act on two different objects that are interacting with each other.
                As a first step, generate the yaml code for the first problem as a test.
        - prompt 2.1: |
                Everything else looks good, except two things:
                    1. the id should just be q-1
                    2. the on_incorrect: field should just be "Not quite, try again!"
                    Now can you try and generate the entire yaml file for the 25 problems?
