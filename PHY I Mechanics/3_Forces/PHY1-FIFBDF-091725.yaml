            I would like to create a physics problem about Identification of free body diagram forces fr my class. The problem consists of the following parts:
                1. A situation involving an object acted on by three external forces.
                2. Three corect answers:
                a. Each answer should describe an external force (including gravity) acting on the object
                3. Two distractors
                a. Distractor 1: Force by the object on the external
                b. Distractor 2: The force of the object moving
                Here is an example:

                Situation: A wooden crate is sliding down a snowey hill at a constant velocity.

                Correct 1: Normal force by the ground on the crate
                Correct 2: The force of gravity on the crate
                Correct 3: The force of kentic friction on the crate
                Distractor 1: The force of the crate's motion up the hill
                Distractor 2: The force of the crate on the ground

                first, create 5 different versions according to this example format.
