            I would like to create a physics problem about Identification of free body diagram forces for my class. The problem consists of the following parts:
                1. A situation involving an inanamate object acted on by exactly three non negligable external forces, A boat is floating at rest on a lake, a block sliding down a rough incline plane, an hockey puck gliding on ice.
                2. Three corect answers:
                a. An external force such as friction bouyancy normal force, aplied force, tention force
                b. A second external force such as friction bouyancy normal force, aplied force, tention force
                a. Each answer should describe an external force (including gravity) acting on the object
                3. Two distractors
                a. Distractor 1: Force by the object on the external
                b. Distractor 2: The force of the object moving
                Here is an example:

                Situation: A wooden crate is sliding down a snowey hill at a constant velocity.

                Correct 1: Normal force by the ground on the crate
                Correct 2: The force of gravity on the crate
                Correct 3: The force of kentic friction on the crate
                Distractor 1: The force of the crate's motion up the hill
                Distractor 2: The force of the crate on the ground

                first, create 5 different versions according to this example format no emoji.
        - prompt 1.1:  |
                
                
        - prompt 1.2:  | 
                Great, write another 10 different versions please.
        - prompt 1.3:  |
                Great, now generate another batch of 10 such problem descriptions
