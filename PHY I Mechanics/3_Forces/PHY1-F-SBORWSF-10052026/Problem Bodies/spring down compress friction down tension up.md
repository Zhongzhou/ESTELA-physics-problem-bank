### Solution Steps

The solution is found by applying Newton's First Law, as the block is in static equilibrium. ⚖️

1.  **Identify Forces:** First, identify all forces acting on the block parallel to the ramp.
    * The **upward forces** are the tension ($T$) from the string and the spring force ($F_{spring} = k\Delta x$).
    * The **downward forces** are the force of static friction ($f_s$) and the parallel component of the block's weight ($F_{g,\parallel} = Mg\sin(\theta)$).

2.  **Set Up Equilibrium Equation:** Since the net force is zero, the total upward force must equal the total downward force.
    $$T + k\Delta x = f_s + Mg\sin(\theta)$$

3.  **Isolate the Mass (M):** Algebraically rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown mass, M.
    $$M = \frac{T + k\Delta x - f_s}{g\sin(\theta)}$$

4.  **Calculate the Result:** Substitute the given numerical values for tension, spring constant, compression distance, static friction, angle, and gravity into the final equation to calculate the mass.

The final answer is **11.95 kg**.
