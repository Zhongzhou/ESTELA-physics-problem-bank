    bank_id: PHY1-F-SBORWSFUPDATE-10042025
    description: |-
      A set of isomorphic problems involving a block in static equilibrium on an inclined plane. The block is acted upon by a compressed spring, an external pulling force (tension), gravity, and static friction, with all non-gravitational forces acting up the ramp.
    date created: 10-04-2025
    learning objectives:
      - Apply Newton's First Law to a static system on an inclined plane.
      - Decompose the force of gravity into components parallel and perpendicular to an incline.
      - Solve for an unknown variable in a static equilibrium equation involving spring force, tension, and friction.
    generation prompts:
        - prompt 1: |
            For the situation in this image, write a physics problem asking for the mass of the block. Tension is pulling the block up the ramp. Give the magnitude of static friction, don't give the coefficient of static friction. The spring is compressed and has spring constant k, so the spring force points up the ramp. The friction force is pointing up the ramp in this problem. Write a symbolic equation for the solution.
        - prompt 2: |
            Generate 4 sets of positive random numbers for T, f_s, k, \theta and \Delta x (the compression of the spring), then calculate M. \theta should be between 20 and 40 degrees. T, f_s and k\times(\Delta x) should be of similar order of magnitudes. If M is negative, significantly less than 0.1, or greater than 100, regenerate the random numbers. List all the numbers in a data table.
        - prompt 3: |
            Create 4 isomorphic versions of the problem, each problem should correspond to one set of random numbers, and ask for a different variable: T, k, \Delta x, M. In each of the problem bodies, state that the spring is placed at the bottom of the ramp, and don't mention the direction of spring force in the problem. Specify the decimal places that the answer should be rounded to.
        - prompt 4: |
            Write a concise solution for the first problem, outlining the mains steps of the solution, but don't list numerical calculation details.
        - prompt 4.1: |
            Great, use the same format, write the problem solution for the other three problems.
        - prompt 5: |
            Now let's put the four problems and four solutions together, and write them into a yaml format according to the following example:

      A block of unknown mass M is held stationary on a ramp inclined at 33.50°. A string pulls the block up the ramp with a tension of 45.25 N. At the bottom of the ramp, a spring with a spring constant of 250.00 N/m is compressed by 0.12 m. The block is kept from sliding down by a static friction force of 18.80 N acting up the ramp.

      Assuming the acceleration due to gravity is <latex>g = 9.81 \, m/s^2</latex>, what is the mass M of the block? Round your answer to two decimal places.

          This solution is found by applying Newton's First Law, as the block is in static equilibrium.

          1.  **Identify Forces:** First, identify all forces acting on the block parallel to the ramp. The **upward forces** are the tension (T), the force of static friction (<latex>f_s</latex>), and the spring force from compression (<latex>F_{spring} = k\Delta x</latex>). The only **downward force** is the parallel component of the block's weight (<latex>F_{g,\parallel} = Mg\sin(\theta)</latex>).

          2.  **Set Up Equilibrium Equation:** Since the net force is zero, the total upward force must equal the total downward force.
              <latex>
              T + f_s + k\Delta x = Mg\sin(\theta)
              </latex>

          3.  **Isolate the Mass (M):** Algebraically rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown mass, M.
              <latex>
              M = \frac{T + f_s + k\Delta x}{g\sin(\theta)}

          This solution is found by applying Newton's First Law, as the block is in static equilibrium.

          1.  **Identify Forces:** First, identify all forces acting on the block parallel to the ramp. The only **upward force** is the tension (T). The **downward forces** are the spring force due to extension (<latex>F_{spring} = k\Delta x</latex>), the force of static friction (<latex>f_s</latex>), and the parallel component of the block's weight (<latex>F_{g,\parallel} = Mg\sin(\theta)</latex>).

          2.  **Set Up Equilibrium Equation:** Since the net force is zero, the total upward force must equal the total downward force.
              <latex>
              T = k\Delta x + f_s + Mg\sin(\theta)

          This solution is found by applying Newton's First Law, as the block is in static equilibrium.

          1.  **Identify Forces:** First, identify all forces acting on the block parallel to the ramp. The **upward forces** are the external pushing force (F) and the spring force from extension (<latex>F_{spring} = k\Delta x</latex>). The **downward forces** are the force of static friction (<latex>f_s</latex>) and the parallel component of the block's weight (<latex>F_{g,\parallel} = Mg\sin(\theta)</latex>).

          2.  **Set Up Equilibrium Equation:** Since the net force is zero, the total upward force must equal the total downward force.
              <latex>
              F + k\Delta x = f_s + Mg\sin(\theta)
              </latex>

          3.  **Isolate the Spring Extension (Δx):** Algebraically rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown extension, Δx.
              <latex>
              \Delta x = \frac{f_s + Mg\sin(\theta) - F}{k}
              </latex>

          4.  **Calculate the Result:** Substitute the given numerical values into the final equation to calculate the extension distance.

      A block of unknown mass M is held stationary on a ramp inclined at 36.50°. An external force of 65.00 N pushes the block up the ramp. At the top of the ramp, a spring with a spring constant of 280.00 N/m is extended by 0.25 m. The block is kept from sliding by a static friction force of 45.50 N acting up the ramp.

      Assuming the acceleration due to gravity is <latex>g = 9.81 \, m/s^2</latex>, what is the mass M of the block? Round your answer to two decimal places.
