        - prompt 1: |
            I would like to create a physics problem about Identification of free body diagram forces for my class. The problem consists of the following parts:
                1. A situation involving an inanamate object acted on by exactly three non negligable external forces, A boat is floating at rest on a lake, a block sliding down a rough incline plane, an hockey puck gliding on ice.
                2. Three corect answers:
                a. An external force such as friction bouyancy normal force, aplied force, tention force
                b. A second external force such as friction bouyancy normal force, aplied force, tention force
                a. Each answer should describe an external force (including gravity) acting on the object
                3. Two distractors
                a. Distractor 1: Force by the object on the external
                b. Distractor 2: The force of the object moving
                Here is an example:

                Situation: A wooden crate is sliding down a snowey hill at a constant velocity.

                Correct 1: Normal force by the ground on the crate
                Correct 2: The force of gravity on the crate
                Correct 3: The force of kentic friction on the crate
                Distractor 1: The force of the crate's motion up the hill
                Distractor 2: The force of the crate on the ground

                first, create 5 different versions according to this example format no emoji.
        - prompt 1.1:  |
                Great, write another 10 different versions please.
        - prompt 1.2:  | 
                Great, write another 10 different versions please.
        - prompt 1.3:  |
                Great, now generate another batch of 10 such problem descriptions
        - prompt 2:   |
                I have 25 versions of the description of physics problems in this file. I would like to write them into the yaml format, as shown in the example in the YAML_formating_prompt. Here are the requirements:
                1. Each problem body should explain the problem situation, then ask “Which of the following are valid forces acting on the object in its free-body diagram? Select all that apply.”.
                2. The solution to each problem should be short and mostly the same across multiple problems, stating that free body diagrams only include real external forces acting on the object not forces by the object acting on external objects also motion forces are not real
                As a first step, generate the yaml code for the first problem as a test
    updates: 
        - update 1: 
            - description: Checked for unreasonable scenarios, added force type to distractor, changed question text, and removed choice lock.
            - prompt 1: |
                I have this yaml file that contains 25 problems. I would like you to check and update three things about each question:
                1. check if the problem context involves an object in motion. For example, "a boat is floating at rest on a lake" is not moving, so it should be changed to " a boat floating at constant velocity on a lake".
                2. Change the wording of the question into "Which of the following forces should be included in the free-body diagram of the [object]?", where [object] should be replaced by the object in the problem body.
                3. One of the choice item is in the form of "The force of the [object] on the [external]". For this item, add the nature of the force, such as "normal force" or "pressure force".
                Please re-generate the yaml for the problems, starting with problems 1-5.
            - prompt 2: |
                For q1, change the two options involving anchor to something else because there is no anchor involved in the problem.
            - prompt 3: |
                One more thing, remove all the "lock" features. Regenerate yaml for question 1 - 5 please
            - prompt 4: |
                Now update the yaml for problems 6 - 15:
                1. check if context involves motion
                2. Update question text
                3. Add force type of one of the choice items
                4. Check if choice items contain additional objects not mentioned in the problem text (if yes, re-write choice item)
                5. remove the "lock" field.

                Also create a summary of which items have been re-written and why
            # the rest of the problems are also corrected by simply prompting the AI.

        A free-body diagram includes only real, external forces acting on the object 
        (e.g., weight, normal, friction, tension, buoyancy). Forces the object exerts 
        on its surroundings and “motion/inertia” are not forces on the object.
