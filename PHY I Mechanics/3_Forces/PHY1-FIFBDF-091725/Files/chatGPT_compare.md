**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Weight (gravity)
* B. Buoyant force from the water
* C. Water resistance (drag)

**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Weight (gravity)
* B. Normal force from the table

### Q10 (Satellite reboost against orbital decay)

**Problem body:**
A low-Earth-orbit satellite experiences a small atmospheric drag force that slowly reduces its orbital speed. Periodically, the satellite fires its thrusters briefly to **counter orbital decay (reboost)**. During a thruster firing, which forces act on the satellite?

**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Gravitational force from Earth
* B. Atmospheric drag
* C. Thrust from the satellite’s engines
* D. Normal force from the “orbit path”
* E. “Force of motion” along its orbit

### Q17 (Two-block system: bottom block coasts and slows)

**Problem body:**
Two blocks are stacked, with a small block resting on a larger bottom block. The bottom block is given a brief push across a horizontal table and then released. It continues moving but **slows down**. Which forces act on the **bottom block** while it is sliding?

**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Weight (gravity) on the bottom block
* B. Normal force from the table on the bottom block
* C. Friction force from the table on the bottom block
* D. Normal force from the top block on the bottom block
* E. “Force of motion” carrying it forward

### Q22 (Buoyancy made non-trivial: object submerged in water)

**Problem body:**
An object is fully submerged in water and released. It accelerates upward toward the surface. Which forces act on the object while it is underwater?

**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Weight (gravity)
* B. Buoyant force from the water
* C. Water resistance (drag)
* D. Normal force from the surface of the water
* E. “Force of motion” upward

### Q25 (Bowling ball skidding so kinetic friction applies)

**Problem body:**
A bowling ball is thrown down the lane with significant backspin so that, at first, it is **skidding (slipping)** along the lane rather than rolling without slipping. While skidding, it **slows down**. Which forces act on the ball during the skidding phase?

**Choices (select all that apply):**

* A. Weight (gravity)
* B. Normal force from the lane
* C. Kinetic friction from the lane
* D. Tension force from a rope
* E. “Force of motion” down the lane
