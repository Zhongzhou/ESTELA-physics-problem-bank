      This is an example problem bank for assessment problems.

    learning objectives:
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: |
            I am creating physics problems about Newton's 3rd law of motion. The problems involve two moving objects colliding, one larger than the other. One example is a flying bug hits the windshield of a truck driving on the highway. Another example is a tennis ball being hit by a tennis racket. Can you please first come up with 15 similar scenarios?
        - prompt 2: | 
            Replace #2: Don't involve liquid, #3, #5, #8 don't involve traffic accidents or other tragedy,  
        - prompt 3: |
            The two objects must be both moving, or is subjected to move after the collision. Replace all the ones that involve stationary objects, such as #7 and #5 (stationary can).
        - prompt 4: |
            Replace #15 which will cause an accident or a tragedy.
        - prompt 5: | # The example is problem 0 below.
            Now I would like to write the problem body and the choices of each problem, in a yaml format. I have written an example problem for the bug and truck situation below. Please follow this example and write the yaml of the first 5 problems.
        - prompt 6: | # I initially wanted to select 5 out of 10 scenarios, but I realized that the 5 are 
            Now i would like you to create five more similar problems, but this time, give me 10 situations in which a human, animal, robot, vehicle or similar things that can "exert" a force pushes or pulls on another object that is inanimate but can move. For example, a person pushes his co-worker sitting on an office chair, or a robot arm slides a package down a conveyor belt, or similar situations.
        - prompt 7: |
            Great, now let's write all the 10 problems, following the examples above. Note that for each of those 10 scenarios, state that the motion has just started, for example: when the person starts to push the cart, or when the truck starts to pull the car. Then ask students to select the correct statement
        - prompt 8: |
            The problem bodies are way too short. it should contain a description of the situation, then a statement of the action being just started, and finally ask students to select the correct statement. Strictly follow the structure of the distractors in problems 1 - 15.
        - prompt 9: |
            Great, now in those last 10 problems, replace "accelerate" with "start moving" or " moves" in the problem description.
        - prompt 10: |
            One important point: for the last 10 problems, make sure the "mover" always have greater mass than the object being moved. Update all the problems that violates this, and list the question numbers that have been updated.
