    learning objectives:
    generation prompts: # The following are the prompts that generated the questions in the problem bank.
        - prompt 1: |
            I am creating physics problems about Newton's 3rd law of motion. The problems involve two moving objects colliding, one larger than the other. One example is a flying bug hits the windshield of a truck driving on the highway. Another example is a tennis ball being hit by a tennis racket. Can you please first come up with 15 similar scenarios?
        - prompt 2: | 
            Replace #2: Don't involve liquid, #3, #5, #8 don't involve traffic accidents or other tragedy,  
        - prompt 3: |
            The two objects must be both moving, or is subjected to move after the collision. Replace all the ones that involve stationary objects, such as #7 and #5 (stationary can).
        - prompt 4: |
            Replace #15 which will cause an accident or a tragedy.
        - prompt 5: | # The example is problem 0 below.
            Now I would like to write the problem body and the choices of each problem, in a yaml format. I have written an example problem for the bug and truck situation below. Please follow this example and write the yaml of the first 5 problems.
