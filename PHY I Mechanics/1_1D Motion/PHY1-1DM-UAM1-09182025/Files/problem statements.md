### **Bicyclist starting from rest**

**1**
A cyclist pushes off from a red light and steadily picks up speed on a straight road. After 4.0 seconds, the cyclist’s speedometer shows about 6.0 m/s. Assuming the bike started from rest, how strong was the steady pickup of speed during this interval?

**2**
A cyclist starts pedaling hard from a stop and covers about 18 meters before coasting. At that point the speedometer shows 6.0 m/s. How long did it take the rider to reach that speed?


### **Car braking to a stop**

**1**
A car is cruising down a highway at about 27 m/s (roughly 60 mph). The driver brakes steadily and comes to a full stop in 4.5 seconds. What was the steady slowdown rate during braking?

**2**
A car going 27 m/s (60 mph) sees a stop sign and brakes to a halt. It travels about 91 meters during the braking. How many seconds did the braking last?


### **Skier descending a slope**

**1**
A skier glides straight down a gentle slope. Pushing off with a small start speed of 2.0 m/s, the skier travels 22.5 meters in 5.0 seconds. What speed is the skier moving at the end of that time?

**2**
Another skier begins with a 1.5 m/s glide and after 6.0 seconds of steady speeding up, is moving at 6.3 m/s. What was the steady rate of speed increase on the slope?


### **Ball thrown vertically upward**

**1**
A student tosses a ball straight up with an initial push that makes it rise at 10.0 m/s. The ball slows down steadily under gravity until it momentarily stops at the very top. How much time passes from the toss until the ball reaches that peak?

**2**
A ball is tossed upward with a speed of 12.0 m/s. It slows under gravity until it briefly comes to rest at the top of its path. How high above the release point does the ball rise?


### **Train leaving a station**

**1**
A train departs from rest on a straight track and covers about 200 meters while building speed. The trip from the platform to that point takes 28.3 seconds. What was the steady acceleration of the train?

**2**
A train pulls out of a station and begins from rest. It steadily speeds up along a 300-meter stretch with a uniform pickup rate of 0.60 m/s². How fast is the train going at the end of this stretch?
