# User Prompts from This Chat

1. *Initial request:*  
"I'm writing physics problems involving two segments of motion with constant acceleration along a straight line.  Here are some examples: 1) A sprinter accelerates out of the blocks for some time till she reaches her top speed, which she then maintains for the rest of the race. 2) A car accelerates to 60mph and then brakes to a complete stop. 3) A car is coasting when a driver sees red light and presses the brakes to a complete stop after some reaction time. 

As a first step, help me by doing the following: come up with 5 ideas of some object undergoing some motion along a straight line either under its own drive or being propelled by some other object or external force. For each object, conjure a reasonably realistic scenario in which the object undergoes motion with constant acceleration in two segments, where each segment could be speeding up, slowing down, or moving with constant velocity. Provide a table of the objects and their proposed two segment motion."

2. *Second request:*  
"For each of the above objects, make a table of realistic ranges for speed and acceleration in relevant units.

As you know, each segment of motion with constant acceleration has five parameters: the displacement (Δr⃗), the instantaneous velocities at the beginning (v⃗i) and end (v⃗f) of the segment, the constant acceleration during the segment (a⃗), and the time interval (Δt) that elapsed during the segment; where only three of the five parameters are required to fully determine the segment, and the other two can be determined using the kinematic equations. 

For each of the above scenarios, suggest a reasonably realistic full set of parameters for the two segments in contextually relevant units. Make sure that the parameters are somewhat realistic and satisfy logical and physical consistency: the parameters of each segment satisfy the kinematic equations, and the final velocity of the first segment is the same as the initial velocity of the first segment. Present a summary in a table."

3. *Third request:*  
"Next, for each scenario, write three context-rich realistic problem statements where a different set of 5 of the 10 variables are given with the following constraints: 1) 3 of the kinematic variables from segment 1 are known (implicitly or explicitly given.)  
2) 2 of the kinematic variables from segment 2, other than the initial velocity are known.
3) if any of the values is 0, then it must count as one of the known, and it must be given implicitly. 
4) redo any variation where the displacements and time-intervals for both segments are given.
5) make the point of the problem is to figure out the overall displacement or the overall time or the final velocity of the second segment.

In total, these are 15 variations of the problems: scenarios 1 through 5 and variations a through c. Organize your response as follows: Label: scenario and variation. Given and ask. problem statement."

4. *Fourth request:*  
"remove scenarios 1c, 2c, 3a, 3c, 4a, 5a, 5b, 5c from the list. for scenario 4c, make both segments as positive acceleration. Write three more scenarios for a skydiver dropping from rest for some time, then opening the parachute all the way to the ground. vary the values of the physical quantities from one scenario to the next, but they should all be realistic. Before listing all 10 scenarios, show me the skydiver scenarios in a similar format as above."

---

5. *Fifth request:*  
"rephrase the skydiver scenarios as a package being dropped off from a flying drone. for scenario S2, do not provide the acceleration for the second segment, but rather ask what acceleration would be required for the package to completely stop just before it touches the ground."

---

6. *Sixth request:*  
"for scenario P3, assume dropping from rest, do not provide t1."

---

7. *Seventh request:*  
"Now merge P1-P3 with the 7 earlier scenarios. Remove all algebraic signs from any given physical quantities in the question head. Later, when we solve the problems, we will indicate their direction relative to a coordinate system using positive and negative unit vectors."

---

8. *Eighth request:*  
"For the first problem, write a solution in the following format:
1. Acknowledge that there are two segments of motion with distinct constant accelerations in 1-D. Label each segment with its starting and ending events. Make a brief statement about which variables are given, and which variable is to be found. No need to be quantitative in this step. If the question is about a physical quantity that is the magnitude of another physical quantity, make that explicit. 
2. Pick a coordinate system and be explicit about what direction is assumed to be the positive direction for the assumed axes. 3.  For each segment, make a table of the kinematic variables: displacement, initial instantaneous velocity, final instantaneous velocity, acceleration, and time interval. For each variable indicate whether it is implicitly or explicitly given or put a question mark if it is to be solved for and indicate their magnitudes and directions relative to the chosen coordinate system. Use vector notation to describe the physical quantities: the displacement (Δr⃗), the instantaneous velocities at the beginning (v⃗i) and end (v⃗f) of the segment, the constant acceleration during the segment (a⃗). Use unit vectors (î and ĵ) for vector notation. When writing a physical quantity, the unit should precede the direction information.
3. Next identify the kinematic equation to be used based on the knowns and unknowns. 
4. Start from the common form of the kinematic equation and algebraically manipulate the equation to find the variable to be solved for. 
5. Substitute for the variables and solve. Make sure to include the signs indicating the directions."
