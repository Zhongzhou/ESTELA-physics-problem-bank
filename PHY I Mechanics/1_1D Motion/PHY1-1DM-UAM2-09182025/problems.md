# Physics Problem Set: Two-Segment Constant Acceleration Motions

## Scenario 1a — Elevator (upward, symmetric accel then decel)
A modern elevator departs the lobby and follows a comfort profile: it speeds up uniformly for 2.5 s at 1.2 m/s² starting from rest, then immediately applies a symmetric constant deceleration of 1.2 m/s² for another 2.5 s to arrive level with the target floor. Assuming vertical motion only, determine the total upward rise of the car in SI units.

## Scenario 1b — Elevator (upward, symmetric accel then decel)
The elevator’s controller targets a smooth stop exactly at the floor. It leaves the lobby, starting from rest, and covers 3.75 m while accelerating uniformly at 1.2 m/s². It then applies a constant deceleration of 1.2 m/s² to come to rest at the landing. Compute the total travel time in SI units from departure to level stop.

## Scenario 2a — High-speed train (accelerate then cruise)
Leaving a timing point, a train accelerates uniformly from rest at 0.60 m/s² for 60 s, then holds a constant speed for the next 90 s along a straight, level segment. How far down the line is the train after this 150-s run? Report the magnitude in SI units.

## Scenario 2b — High-speed train (displacement given)
A dispatcher notes: “Train-AS34d started from rest, and covered 1080 m during its uniform acceleration phase (at a rate of 0.60 m/s²), then coasted at that achieved speed for another 3240 m.” Compute the total elapsed time for the two phases in SI units.

## Scenario 3b — Rocket sled (boost then brake)
Data logs show a rocket sled covered 150 m during an initial boost at 12.0 m/s² starting from rest, then engaged a constant braking thrust of 15.0 m/s² to a full stop. Determine the total time of the sled's accelertion and deceleration, in SI units.

## Scenario 4b — Cyclist (downhill then brake to stop)
A cyclist was moving at 5.0 m/s when he encounters a mild grade. The cyclist covers 75 m downhill while uniformly speeding up at a net acceleration of 0.50 m/s². At the bottom of the grade, keeping brake pressure steady, the bike decelerates at 2.00 m/s² to a full stop at the painted line. What is the total combined time, in SI units, for these two phases?

---

## Scenario 4c — Cyclist (two accelerating pushes)
A cyclist rides along a straight training stretch, starting from rest. GPS shows a uniform-acceleration segment with 0.50 m/s² over 75 m, followed by another segment of 25 m where the rider pushes harder and achieves a steady acceleration of 0.80 m/s². What is the cyclist’s speed (in SI units) at the end of this 100-m effort?

## Scenario P1 — Package drop (short freefall, strong parachute)
A drone releases a supply package from rest. The package freefalls straight down for 5.0 s under the influence of gravity alone. Then its parachute deploys, providing a uniform deceleration of 4.0 m/s² until the package comes to rest just as it touches the ground. What is the total vertical distance (in SI units) the package descends during its journey?

---

## Scenario P2 — Package drop (moderate freefall, required parachute deceleration)
A drone releases a package from rest. It falls 245 m straight down under the influence of Earth's gravitaty before the parachute opens. Once open, the chute slows the package uniformly over 15.0 s so that it arrives at the ground with zero vertical velocity. What constant acceleration must the parachute provide to achieve this safe landing? Report its magnitude in SI units.

---

## Scenario P3 — Package drop (long freefall, slower parachute braking)
A drone releases a package from rest. It freefalls vertically for 490 m under constant gravitational acceleration. Then the parachute deploys, providing a uniform deceleration of 2.5 m/s² while the package descends another 200 m until reaching the ground. Determine the total time from release to landing.
