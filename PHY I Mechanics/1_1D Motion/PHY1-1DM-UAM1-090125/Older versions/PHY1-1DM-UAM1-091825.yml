        A cyclist pushes off from a red light and steadily picks up speed on a straight road. After 4.0 seconds, the cyclist’s speedometer shows about 6.0 m/s. Assuming the bike started from rest, how strong was the steady pickup of speed during this interval?
    answer:
        value: 1.5 # The numerical answer to the problem. ONLY the number, with no units or mark down.
        margin_type: percent #the allowed variance is the tolerance percent of the value.
        tolerance: 5 # The tolerance.

            1) Physics & task
               Straight-line motion with constant acceleration, so the kinematic equations apply. From the story: starts from rest, reaches 6.0 m/s in 4.0 s. We seek the acceleration (magnitude along the motion).

        A train pulls out of a station and begins from rest. It steadily speeds up along a 300-meter stretch with a uniform pickup rate of 0.60 m/s². How fast is the train going at the end of this stretch?
    answer:
        value: 18.97 # The numerical answer to the problem. ONLY the number, with no units or mark down.
        margin_type: percent #the allowed variance is the tolerance percent of the value.
        tolerance: 5 # The tolerance.

            1) Physics & task
               Constant-acceleration start. The train begins from rest, covers 300 m with a steady pickup of 0.60 m/s². Find the speed at the end of that stretch (magnitude).

               |---|---|---:|---|
               | Displacement | Δx | 300 m | Explicit |
               | Initial speed | vi | 0.0 m/s | Implicit |
               | Final speed | vf | ? | Solve for |
               | Acceleration | a | 0.60 m/s^2 | Explicit |
               | Time interval | t | — | not needed |
            
            3) Equation choice
               <latex>v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a \\Delta x</latex>.
            
            4) Algebra
               <latex>v_f = \\sqrt{v_i^2 + 2 a \\Delta x}</latex>.
            
            5) Numbers & units
               <latex>v_f = \\sqrt{0.0^2 + 2(0.60)(300)}\\,\\text{m/s} = \\sqrt{360}\\,\\text{m/s} \\approx 18.97\\,\\text{m/s}</latex>.
            
            Answer: <latex>18.97\\ \\text{m/s}</latex>.
