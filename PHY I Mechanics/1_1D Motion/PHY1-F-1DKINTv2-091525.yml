        - prompt 1: |-
            I'm writing physics problems involving the one-dimensional motion of an object with a varying acceleration. As a first step, please help me by generating
            three different scenarios of an object moving in a straight line with two reference points. The object may be moving horizontally, vertically, or along a ramp
            a constant slope, as long as it is moving in a straight line and its path does not curve. The reference objects should make sense based on the context of
            the objects motion. For example, the objects and reference points may be:
            An F1 racecar traveling down a straight track with references being a car that has crashed ahead or behind it, the pole position, the pit stop.
            A rocket flying up with its rockets providing a varying acceleration, and references being the ground and an air balloon or drone at a fixed height.
            Mario racing down a straight track of rainbow road with a stopped bowser or the finish line as reference points.
            An olympic runner running down a straight track with reference points being a friend in the crowd or the finish line.
            A rocket sled going up an inclined ramp with the reference points being a flag along the ramp and the end of the ramp.
        - prompt 2: |
            Now for each of the 10 generated scenarios, please generate the following set of values
            1. The distance of the object relative to the first starting point, x_0, between 0 m and 100 m to three significant figures.
            2. The speed of the object, v_{0x} and the direction of motion right/left, east/west, etc, relative to the starting point,
            at the starting position x_0. This value should be between 0 to 20 m/s and have 3 significant figures
            3. The time it takes for the object reach the second reference point, t, between 0 and 20 s to 3 significant figures
            4. Generate either a velocity versus time function, v_x(t) or an acceleration function a_x(t). This function may be either:
            A simple polynomial with constant coefficients
              a_x(t) = a_0+a_1*t+a_2*t^2
              v_x(t) = v_0+v_1*t+v_2*t^2+v_3*t^3
            An exponentail function
              a_x(t) = a_0*exp(-\omega*t)
              a_x(t) = a_0*(1-exp(-\omega*t))
              v_x(t) = v_0*exp(-\omega*t)
              v_x(t) = v_0*(1-exp(-\omega*t))
            A logarithmic function
              v_x(t) = v_0*ln(1+\omega*t)
            4.  Generate the necessary coefficients in the above functions, a_0, a_1, etc. These coefficients should all be between -1 and 1. Additionally,
            the variable \omega should be between 0 and 0.25. Each value should be given to two significant figures.
            5.  Generate a table and download it as a csv file labeled initialval.csv with a row number labeling each scenario, and columns for all generated values
            of x_0, v_{0x}, t, and the coefficients, a_0, a_1, etc.
        - prompt 3: |
            For each of the 10 scenarios and the corresponding set of numbers, write a physics problem following those steps:
            1. Write a problem in the form of a fun and creative story similar to those found in a general university physics 1 textbook
            about the motion, giving as part of the problem statement a description of the motion
            and values for the variables x_0, v_{0x}, t, and either the generated acceleration function a_x(t) for the object,
            or the velocity function for the object, v_x(t).
            2. If the object is moving up or down an inclined ramp, the problem should give the ramp angle and describe
            that the variable x gives the distance up the ramp.
            3. The direction of motion of the object should also be described in the problem statement, and whether the distance to the
            first reference point at the start of the motion is to the left/right,
            behind/ahead, above/below, etc. but do not give negative values or signs to the quantities.
            4. If the probem gives the acceleration function a_x(t), prompt the student to calculate either:
            the distance between first and second reference points.
            the velocity of the object when it reaches the second reference point.
            5. If instead the problem gives the velocity function v_x(t) for the object, prompt the student instead to calculate either:
            the distance between first and second reference points.
            the acceleration of the object when it reaches the second reference point.
            6.  For each generated problem, calculate the numerical answer and check that:
            if asking for the distance between the first and second reference point, that the value is between 0 and 1000
            if asking for the velocity, that it's magnitude is between 0.5 and 100
            if asking for the acceleration, that it's magnitude is between 0.5 and 50
            If the solutions pass the check, continue, if not, regenerate the numerical values of the given variables and coefficients and check again
            until the solutions lie within the specified ranges.
            7.  Specify the correct number of significant figures required for the answer based on the value with the least number of significant digits.
        - prompt 4: |
            Write student facing solutions for the each problem. Each solution should include the following elements:
            1. If the acceleration function a_x(t) is given, a description that of how to obtain the position and velocity functions by integrating the
            acceleration function twice.
            2. A step-by-step LaTeX solution showing how the indefinite integration is carried out to find the position and velocity functions as functions of time.
            3. Next, explain how to apply the initial values x_0 and v_{0x} to specify the constants of integration. Include positive or negative signs here as
            appropriate based on the problem description (distance ahead/behind and direction of motion.)
            4. Finally, explain how to evaluate these functions at the time t to obtain the final position and velocity of the objects.
            5. Interpret the signs of the answers in terms of before/after the starting reference point and direction of motion of the object.
            6. If instead the velocity function v_x(t) is given, repeat the above except:
            Integrate only once to find the position function
            Explain how to find the acceleration function by differentiation and show the steps symbolically in LaTeX as above.
            Repeat steps 3-6 to finish the description of the solution.

      A small robot named *Rollerbot* is programmed to travel **forward** in a straight corridor inside a science museum. It begins its motion **80.245 m ahead** of the starting line, moving with an initial speed of **15.632 m/s**. It continues moving for **12.370 s**, with a velocity that varies over time according to:

      v_x(t) = 0.85 - 0.24t - 0.31t^2 + 0.49t^3
      </latex>

        Differentiate velocity to get acceleration:

        a_x(t) =\frac{d}{dt} \left[ 0.58(1 - e^{-0.11t}) \right] = 0.58 \cdot 0.11 \cdot e^{-0.11t}
