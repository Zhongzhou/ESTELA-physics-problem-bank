        I would like to create a physics problem about Identification of free body diagram forces for my class. The problem consists of the following parts:
           1. A situation involving an object acted on by a variable external
             force F(x) = A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D, where A, B, C, and D are
             constants. The object moves along the x-axis from x = x_initial
             to x = x_final.
           2. The question should ask:
             "What is the work done by this force as the object moves from
             x_initial to x_final?"
          3. The answer type should be Multiple Choice, symbolic response,
             with one correct answer and four distractors.
          4. The correct answer must show the integral of F(x) over the
             displacement
              W = [A x^4/4 + B x^3/3 + C x^2/2 + D x]_{x_initial}^{x_final}
          a. Simply multiply the distance:
                (A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D)(x_final - x_initial)

          5. The four distractors should be:
             a. Simply multiply the distance:
                (A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D)(x_final - x_initial)
             b. Flipped upper and lower bounds:
                [A x^4/4 + B x^3/3 + C x^2/2 + D x]_{x_final}^{x_initial}
             c. Derivative instead of integration:
                d/dx [A x^4/4 + B x^3/3 + C x^2/2 + D x]
             d. Integration error:
                [A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D]_{x_initial}^{x_final}

                          6. Example problem format:

             Situation:
                A particle is acted on by the force F(x) = 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 1.
                Calculate the work done from x = 1 to x = 4.

             Correct answer:
                [ (3/4)x^4 + (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x ]₁⁴

             Distractor 1:
                (3x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 1)(4 - 1)

             Distractor 2:
                [ (3/4)x^4 + (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x ]₄₁

             Distractor 3:
                d/dx[(3/4)x^4 + (2/3)x^3 + (3/2)x^2 - x]

             Distractor 4:
                [ 3x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 1 ]₁⁴

          7. Create five different versions of this problem by varying the
             coefficients or powers in F(x). No emojis, no numeric evaluation,
             symbolic expressions only. Make sure all of the Forces are modeled by ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+d no cubic quadratic or liniar forces
