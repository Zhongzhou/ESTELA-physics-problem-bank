        # in standard multiple choice questions, each anser option must have
        #  a 'correct' property
        # this property should have a value of 'false' for every answer except
        #  the single correct one, which should have a value of 'true'

        # set the 'lock' property to the boolean value 'true' on an answer to
        #  keep it in that location when shuffling
        # note that setting 'lock' to 'false' is not necessary, as omitting
        #  the property entirely assumes a value of 'false'

    title: Multiple Answer - Partial Credit
    points: 5
    text: |
        This is a multiple answer question that awards partial credit with a penalty based on chosen answers.  
        Partial credit is awarded for correct answers selected and a penalty is applied for incorrect answers selected.  
        Any option may be locked, preserving that option's position if shuffling is enabled.

    # to enable partial credit and penalties, set the 'partial' property of the question object to 'true'
    # this will give partial credit if some correct answers are selected, but
    #  will also apply score penalties if incorrect answers are selected
    partial: true

        # if this value is set to 'false' or is not set at all, then the answer may be positioned differently if shuffling is enabled
