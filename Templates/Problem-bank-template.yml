    text: | 
      This is example question text which contains an equation: <latex>x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0</latex>.
      We can also write equation in new line using:

      <latex>
      x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
      </latex>

    answer:
        value: 42.2 # The answer to the problem
        tolerance: 0.05 # The tolerance value
    feedback:
        general: The solution of the problem
        on_correct: Good job!
        on_incorrect: Try again!
- numerical: # Another numerical input problem

    text: |
      This is another example question text which contains a different equation: <latex>2x + 3 = 7</latex>.
      We can also write this equation in new line using:

      <latex>
      2x + 3 = 7
      </latex>
    answer:
        value: 2.5 # The answer to the problem
        tolerance: 0.01 # The tolerance value
    feedback:
        general: The solution of the second problem
        on_correct: Well done!
        on_incorrect: Please review your calculations!
